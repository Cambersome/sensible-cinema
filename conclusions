"commercial" players, like windows media player, will "seek" based on 30 fps, even if
  the underlying is 29.97
  however if you allow them to just continue playing, they use wall time, which is 29.97 fps
  
makemkv can give you streams that are up to like 2s out of whack with the DVD.  tsmuxer
 seems to fix those though, if you unmux them.
