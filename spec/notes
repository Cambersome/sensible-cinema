 mpchc 1:23:28 sum mkv [huh? this mkv thing is confusing me...]
 check subtitiles +- file against file, DVD snow white
 mkv file seems to have perfect matching subtitles

== iq ==
  mplayer for the mkv seemed to creep up?  somehow it seemed to get messed up...
    TODO avidemux/quality editor for these various and its frames...what the?
    replaying mkv might not work so hot...
      maybe I can remux somehow first... [?]
      maybe it's because of all those transitions which caused lossy-stuff within the mkv... [?]
    
  can I use hanbrake on mkv output? does it look better?  is it just this one dvd?
    does the mkv match DVD
    
  mplayerdump.mencoderforidx sum: 1:39:17
  DVD sum: 1:35:41
  mkv sum: 1:35:49 [partially explained, partially huh?]
  mkv mac vlc 1:25:20 ish [ugh]
    originally reports it as 1:35:35, this is without daspi
  mac 
    DVD player: 1:35:41
      converted: should be 1:35:46.7
    mplayerx cannot play DVD/seek right
    mpalyerx on makemkv sum: 1:35:53
    vlc on makemkv sum 1:35:49
    mplayer command line makemkv end TS: A:5749.5 == 1:35:49.5
    seems zactly the same
  what about ffmpeg against that thing?
  ffprobe mkv

For MPEG-2 content from a PVR card might be different on applying video filters. I suggest check the MPlayer manual to know how to use the video filter and know what they do.

Let us assume that hqdn3d=2:1.5:3 is a good way to clean up MPEG-2 and yadif=1 is a good decent de-interlacer. I would say that the following should work ok for most content.

Code:
mplayer -vf yadif=1,hqdn3d=2:1.5:3,scale=-1:-1:0
Maybe adding -ssf ls=100 will increase the sharpness of the content to bring out the details of the video. With mencoder, it is a little different on what options you can use compared to mplayer, so play around with the settings.

== subtitle accuracy ==

  narnia dawn treader had 1 subtitle that was "hand crafted", had the wrong timestamps, but was more accurate.  
    The several others were accurate though.

    perfeito

== so...does it work with makemkv without tsmuxer? ==

  using -ofps 30000/1001 -mc 0 -noskip caused the audio/video to mismatch wildly :P

== ja donatei ==

  ossfarm, putty, tons others, I think...

== ffmpeg vs. AVS vs. powerproducer zact timings...splitting fulli ==

  conclusion: 
    mencoder splitting for zact timing seemss off
    ffmpeg is consistent with ffprobe I...would guess.
      which *seems* to match the DVD "quite closely"

  note this was fulli from mplayer rip...though ffmpeg seemed to match better with both [?]

  transition on fulli:
    avs: 59:56.867, pp: 56.90, avidemux: 56.863
      maybe pp was .86 but didn't update its framing right?
  ffprobe shows possible vcodecs at: 3596.826 3596.793 3596.826 3596.8597 3596.893 3596.926 
    counting them: 107790 doesn't line up at all...10 frames off? it must duplicate some frames implicitly...
  ffmpeg at 3596.866 got avidemux's frame: 59:56.930 (107800)
  ffmpeg at 3596.83 got avidemux's frame: 00:59:56.896 (107799)
  ffmpeg at 3596.82 got avidemux's frame: 00:59:56.896 (107798) which seems to match ffprobe...and imply that 3596.826 is the transition frame [?]
   so basically everything is...one frame off? ffmpeg is one frame off from avs/others?
  mplayer DVD OSD: 00:59:53.25 (converted: 3596.84) V:3597.3 [V value huh? ]
    previous frame to transition one was 59:53:21 [pre-switch] (3596.80 converted)
    about one frame off avs/avidemux []
      . = frame advance in mplayer 
      
  title00.ts
    (non-finger frame)
    AVS on ts (not fulli): ffmpeg's 3596.82 frame is shown 57.042 [+ crash?]
    powerproducer: 57.0 even (meaning probably the frame before 57.03)
    mplayer: 4197.0 [second .0], (OSD from file)
    avidemux on .ts: 00:59:57.347 86250 (but the timing is always off for that one...)
    however with fulli I guess we're closer somehow magically [?]
    
    mencoder 3596.82 seemed *way* too early frame-wise...
      used: mencoder1 -ss 3596.82 -endpos 3 -oac copy -ovc copy  title00.ts.mencoder.fulli.mpg -o  title00.ts.mencoder.fulli.mpg.mencoder.3596.82.mpg
    NB: "non knuckles" *is* the first transition frame...
      and it "should" be OSD, above...huh? the ts file is off?
    
  title00.ts.fulli
    AVS 59:56.887 [phew pretty close again...what?]
    conclusion: the ts is a bit off somehow? what?
    powerproducer: 56.86 or 56.90
    
  AVS on original mkv:
    non finger frame: 56.966 (previous was .926)
  
== ? ==

mkv2vob just extracts singles, not re-muxes them [not useful here]
mkvmerge only ... [not useful here]

conclusions: mencoder -forceidx can make a copied rip file play great in mencoder [and presumably be cut right?]
  makemkv has no problems with/signs of internal resets.
  VLC playing any mpeg *file* is actually pretty close to right on [?]

dvdoutmplayer.mpg.mencoder.ofps.mpg did not save avidemux

VLC playing mpeg *file* is actually pretty accurate.  Oh the insanity...I guess the extra abstraction of reading from disc kills it.

mplayer playing mplayergrab *does* reset internally...and osd also fails...interesting...
  *however* running mencoder1 -forceidx c.mpg -ovc copy -oac copy -o c.mencoderidx.mpg *does fix it* (for mplayer anyway...)
    unfortunately unseekable in avidemux...
  makemkv doesn't reset ever...timestamps are I think 29.97 in that case (both OSD, other)
    tsmuxer on that *lacks* timestamps at all in VLC, mplayer is 10 minutes off, it's in french [?]
      splitting it goes a bit early (oh duh it has all the i-frames still...)
      
== splitting osoh/accuracy ==

old way: rip/fulli with mencoder dvdnav+fulli freaky, split with ffmpeg, join with mencoder

  avidemux on this had way off audio--video looked ok
  avs on this: unseekable
  
ffmpeg -i filename -vcodec copy -acodec copy -ss 3595 -t 10 part1.avi
  transition at 1.835 frame 55 that actually might be right...wow it actually seemed to work I am *flabberghasted*
  avidemux can open it well
  AVS can open it, but not seek nor play it [useless]

0.0334 is length of one...except then it ignores that :P

ffprobe (dvdoutmplayer):
  I think pts is what matterz over dts
  duration_time doesn't seem to match LOL.
  3594.904978 3594.955022 [3594.988411 3595.038456] 3595.071822
  videos pts' at: 3596.906978 3596.957022, 3597.040456, 3597.073822, 3597.123878 so telling it 
  last video: 6791.515056 1:13:11.52, or possibly 6791.431644 1:13:11.43
    these don't match AVS precisely...no no...
  first video: pts_time=0.280633 though one was N/A, so what is AVS's 0.016 ? nothing matches? (unless they have some internal counter they're "matching" against it... hmm...)

double check AVS: 

  mplayer 59:56.991 (3596.991) (one at 3596.990411, next at 3597.040456 )
  mkv 56.971 (with lots of back clicks...) 56.987 with 14 clicks... I think hitting the stop button does reset it. clicks divide by 2?
    59:56.969 with lots of forward clicks...
    
  says sum is 1:53:11.334

"ideal" would be a transition at 1.987 I believe (off 59:56.987)

[-5,5]
  1.301 for (avidemux) change of scene for ffmpegdvdout.vlc.8.mpeg, ffmpegdvdoutmplayer.mpg
  2.102 for (avidemux) change of scene ffmpeg.mencoder.dvdoutmplayer.mpg [what is that anyway maybe fulli from dvdoutmplayer ?]
    that looks like an odd difference.  Except maybe they went in different directions searching for an iframe...

  ffmpeg splitting dvdoutmplayer.mencoderfulli.mpeg resulted in no audio avidemux, and the poor video that we saw before in avidemux [way off]
    $ created it with mencoder filename.whatever -of mpeg -mpegopts format=dvd:tsaf -alang en -nocache -sid 1000 -oac copy -vf scale=720:480,harddup -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg2video:vrc_buf_size=1835:vrc_maxrate=9800:vbitrate=5000:keyint=1:vstrict=0:acodec=ac3:abitrate=192:autoaspect -ofps 30000/1001 -o output.mpeg 
    mencoder splitting the same had audio [seemingly not accurate?], and the same way off video.  Seems that 
    *that* fulli is *honestly* messed [same as in how_to I believe] except now I try it again later and it works? maybe -oac copy messed it up?
    mencoder went really fast though :P
    did have oac copy tho...
    
  mencoder splitting OTHER_SIDE_OF_HEAVEN-1handbrake.ffmpeg.fulli.avi:
    audio was the same as the beginning of the movie LOL [needs to be re-transcoded?]
    transition: 00:00:02.080 frame 52...hmm...maybe 3 frames off/late? hmm...well 3 frames (maybe 2) is better than 9 uh guess (still only 0.1s which...maybe acceptable...)
    
 OTHER_SIDE_OF_HEAVEN-1handbrake.ffmpeg.fulli.avi.ffmpeg.10.mpg
    not even VLC can play/open it LOL

    that was handbrake I suppose...
    
  maybe I can survive with raw mpeg -> fulli ...
  
  AVS *might* be a tidge off, too...but I'm starting to think it might be spot on...but maybe not...

  avidemux on "mp4'ed" ffmpeg dvdoutmplayer:
    transition 00:59:56.963 # maybe machete was rounding this up?

  dvdoutmplayer.ffmpeg-copy.ffmpeg.mpg [NB avidemux likes this much better than avi!] 1.3s [like the old one...]
  
  with big avi's avidemux always says "rebuilding frames", also it did not fix avidemux to become frame accurate, with the normal lossless mpeg's in there.
    cannot avidemux seek, or rather it is truly painful! gah!
    cannot seeming AVS seek? dvdoutmplayer.ffmpeg.copy.avi

 OTHER_SIDE_OF_HEAVEN-1handbrake.ffmpeg.fulli.avi
   when played in VLC, seemed to transition at about 59:56.9'ish
  
 OTHER_SIDE_OF_HEAVEN-1handbrake.ffmpeg.fulli.avi.ffmpeg.10.mpg unplayable in even VLC

 dvdoutmplayer.mpg.ffmpeg.mpg.ffmpegcopy.10.mpg played fine 1.3s, maybe it's an mp3 ffmpeg splitter bug thing?
    from avidemux it's cutting at (albeit useless) 00:59:55.720 

  re-avi or mpeg'ing with ffmpeg doesn't save avidemux. k?

maybe if I use ffmpeg to fulli it first...

makemkv => tsmuxer => ts
  avidemux:
    still needed frame shifter...
    audio still off...
    transition 86250 59:57.347
  
I seem unable to very the frames of the HANDBRAKE one LOL.  It keeps segfaulting Avidemux no matter what it's status...

== c ==

conclusions: mplayer's are consistent grabbing cross-platform
  makemkv is consistent size-wise, same boxes...
  vlc seems to always be consistent with itself, frame-wise
  vlc is off of mplayer/mkv by 0.3s, but not at the beginning so what the....
  can discard vlc dvd :)
  one frame off is probably ok/accurate.
  avidemux cannot read makemkv output.

  mplayer1 dvd://1
  
  mpui has the same "crash" with dvdvnav...

vlc dvd-straight  dvd://f:\@1 --sout "#standard{access=file,mux=ts,dst=dvdout.vlc.dvd.3.mpg}" vlc://quit caused it to go past the end of the title and just keep looping oddly :P
  at the end there was a menu but only for about 5s...hmm...
  mplayer can't play it seemingly.
  avidemux thinks it's the menu, 1 frame long
  this is the loopy one
  vlc can play it at the beginning, seeking seems to end early or...take forever?
  
vlc dvdsimple
  that file plays in VLC without timestamps, with always 00:00, seeking takes forever :P

== timing dvd player time versus clock/wall time: ==

at 1:44:00 or so I seemed about 6s ahead. yup yup.
  at end, I had like 1:53:20'ish'ish [?] (ok probably like 1:53:11 but who knows for sure :P)

appears that 29.97 is closer to "wall clock time" and DVD players tell you 1:00:00 when it has taken you 1:00:04 in reality.
  at 1:00:00 wristwatch was about 4s ahead

== using handbrake's file for splitting ==

I think it's accurate...and with conversion to fulli editable in avidemux :P

using ffmpeg/mencoder against handbrake, they seemed to be a few seconds forward I think...sigh...
  TODO figure out how to use handbrake, if I ever need to <sigh> it's almost user friendly, dang!
  TODO try the parsers on the...handbrake fella somehow? avidemux?
  maybe convert to mpeg or something +- GOP 1
  maybe handbrake is "reading my mind" time-wise and inserting 30fps timestamps on each frame?

== mplayer dvdnav  ==

mplayer os x extended has the same "where am I?" on this DVD problem mplayer has.

monsters' inc. plays fine with CCCP+WMP in XP.  No 'where am I?' syndrome.

== avidemux on ripped files ==

my *guess* is that any transcoding will save it, anything else won't :( [bounty is out for it though!]

avidemux barely off lips:
  mencoder -forceidx -oac copy -ovc copy  dvdoutmplayer.mpg -o yo3.mpg is unseekable
  ffmpeg -i dvdoutmplayer.mpg -sameq yo.mpg took forever, grabbed wrong audio track :P

avidemux from all "normal" rips are still off frame-rate wise somehow...

  "wretch" and "me" were visually on, WMP, VLC, VLC on a VLC grab was either on or really really close, mplayer is right on with the DVD

  handbrake file:
    segfault

  AVS

    seems to get the audio right LOL. No frame counts but does seem to have frame accurate seek/timing
    59:56.97 mplayer grab [!]
  
  AviDemux ffmpeg.fulli 59:56.96 without frame adjustment [!] (prolly doesn't even need the fulli, it's just the consistent frames it needs [?])

  mencoder/ffmpeg "save" avidemux without fulli?
    maybe mencoder with -idx is good nuff to fix it for avidemux?

  ffmpeg on OSOH.handbrake.m4v *fail* 12GB, freezes Avidemux, no video VLC
  
  ffmpegifying mplayerraw: no audio in avidemux, same frame: 28650 00:59:57.347

  mencodefiying mplayerraw (mpeg -> mpeg): 
    mencoder1 dvdoutmplayer.mpg -o dvdoutmplayer.mencoderified.mpg -forceidx -oac copy -ovc copy

    machete 
      won't open the mkv file

  playing OSOH with mplayer resulted in *one* mpg_demux switching frames message, at the beginning...and yet this means avidemux was hosed?
    I guess so, since its audio was very accurate, it has no video adjust, it is hosed.s
    
  AVS dvdout.7.mpg
    transition: 59:56.994 [appears right on, this is accurate]
    
  mencoderified mpeg fulli:
    had to set frame rate to 24.  Actually that didn't work it was just broke
    audio right on though
    so non editable avidemux
      actually it shouldn't matter, since we just use this internally, and ffmpeg likes it,
      maybe they can only use the original for editing
      assuming it still works to cut it well though...
  
  ffmpegified dvdoutmplayer avidemux (mpeg -> mpeg no transcoding):
    no audio, transition at 86250 00:59:57.347 (exactly same as normal mpeg)
  
  avidemux on mkv raw sintel:
    no video
    
  avs on mkv raw sintel:
    seems to work great, took awhile loading :P
    
  avs on dvdoutmplayer.mpg:
    cannot seek
  
  avs on mencoder.fulli.mpg (of the above):
    cannot seek or play...is this normal? Is it just me?
  
== DVD player versus PC player various times ==

conclusions:
  VLC's are all pretty consistent across platforms/versions
  VLC DVD playback can be 30s off
  mplayers are at the 29.97 offset
    I think mplayer.exe's are pretty consistent across platforms/versions
    smplayer off a tidge, of course, blame on being a GUI
    dumpstream is md5 accurate, length accurate too
  WMP is pretty close, but internally inconsistent by some odd
  powerdvd is pretty close but internally inconsistent by some odd factor.
  mplayer grab seems very consistent, and "correct" (well, when played back with VLC, so loose rating there).
  mencoder didn't grab it all the way? but is md5 accurate, even with dvdnav or without [can disregard]
  VLC grabs it fine
  WMP on handbrake'd is around 29.97 -- couldn't play back the mplayer grab, guessed on the VLC grab
  fulli on handbrake does "save" avidemux [full editable] [unfortunately that's handbrake...]

speeds: ffmpeg: vertex 2 SSD: 105MB/s old HD desktop 58 MB/s

I wonder if mplayer is just a little bit ahead, or internally inconsistent based on poor seeking for GOP's or some odd...it's either right ahead or right on?

appears smplayer is "like a second" or something behind mplayer, and mplayer doesn't quite agree with VLC but is pretty close, and mplayer.exe seems internally consistent.

are all windows GUI wrapper players internally inconsistent, except maybe VLC which is still itself "a tidge off"?

  can play dvd:// and dvdnav:// with seeking at the beginning without crashing...[because old, maybe?]
  mulder's: http://mulder.googlecode.com/files/MPUI.2010-10-17.Full-Package.exe crashes like normal [dvdnav only]
    smplayers seem to always play dvd:// so never crash [?]

the internet seems to "not tell me" if transcode's avisplit is frame accurate or not.

watching a DVD "from the new DVD ISO" in smplayer seemed to have the right audio always. yep.
  i.e. transcoding from dvd flick fixed it [probably]

previewing section on HP 2 hours or so and the first thing overlapped the muted section in error...went too long...huh?

  resulted in sectors of 13.17 1.93, 5.03 instead of 10.5, 1.5, and 4. huh?
   with FFmpeg version SVN-r19313, [BAD VERSION probably]
  call ffmpeg -i C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -vcodec copy -acodec copy  -ss 7260.0 -t 10.499 yo.1.avi

$ to fix mplayer out of sync audio:
$ ffmpeg -i HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -target ntsc-dvd -t 1600 yo.mpg
seemed to be as good as adding a harddup via mplayer.  except...umm...VLC can play it right so why can't mplayer?  Hopefully all doesn't matter [?]

ffmpeg "copy copy" on HP fulli seemed to not have audio when that was replayed via mplayer.

monsters inc. overlaps at 25 minutes, 50'ish, 70, "when they land" and there's like 30 'select scenes' (chapters) in that time frame...

bob "they will come" has no mplayer overlap (45 minutes long)

HP 2 "full and edited version" had a twidge off of audio even in VLC (unsure if that was copy or lavc audio)
  seems consistent
  The DVD (flick) burned, then played, appeared to have audio in perfect sync, always.
  seems to play fine in smplayer
  the fulli version was *totally off* in smplayer
  fulli, edited version had some artifacts in VLC
  fulli version had perfect audio in VLC
  audio looks barely off VLC for the whole thing

mplayer (updated) playing dvd:// (bob) can't seek if past 30 minutes or so (pause/hang)

mplayer (updated) playback, if it ever goes off the screen, chokes and hurles and dies (or if it goes under a window that is always on top).

an edl with (updated mplayer and) dvdnav:// (bob) results in a crash when seeking the first few seconds, at least.

Seeking using the "forward 10, back 10" works in mplayer console, 
  also works (!) with smplayer (+10, back 10).
  
Also edl works *perfectly* when playing from the ripped file.

There is only one break in cars DVD. A:3756
  Is it the same in other large DVD's?
  so certainly, mplayer's edl playback is broken currently, for DVD's.

if I change the mute to 2:13, then it works [!], though probably doubly.

"enable dvd menus" in mplayer doesn't seem to help with seeking weirdness in smplayer

smplayer edl against cars DVD *fails* on later ones (1:05), but succeeds on 15:00, mute-wise.
Like epic fail.
also seeking totally fails:
  58 -> 58 works (cars)
  transition to broken seeking:1:02:44
  also always thinks its chapter 1 :)
  
smplayer playing cars fulli (of some sort) seems to be a split second off, audio-wise

smplayer on HP2 -> edited version (ffmpeg through mencoder) with oac copy, is off by an annoying split second when replayed in smplayer
 at other times, it fails everywhere almost, sync-wise
  that "might" have been with HP and -oac lavc, but without harddup.  or maybe it was -oac copy
  VLC plays the audio splendidly on the same.
  plays well from DVD, though.  Just that one file isn't playable with mplayer...
  how does EDL fit into all of this, though?
  also note that mplayer originally couldn't cut right because of audio (with oac copy, I believe)

ffmpeg said that the huge HP grab was always 48 minute duration [?] (then proceeded to work right)

edl *fails* with HP at the 2 hour mark, audio.  The audio did seem to line up, at least, with their lips.
  and if it's video--fails the same. Seems to think it's at second 2678, or minute 44, not minute 120?

smplayer on bob pets pickle and baby has sync'ed audio with oac copy
  in general, if it starts sync'ed, smplayer stays in sync all the way through
  
got av_interleaved_write_frame(): Operation not permitted
  on call ffmpeg -i C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -vcodec copy -acodec copy  -'
;?Pss 749.0 -t 4109.999 C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.5.avi
  then it passed (reading off the "old fulli" with poor audio) when did it again. huh?
  out of disk perhaps??
  
edl works *great* with cars at 15 minutes, and appears to at an hour, too.  Oh, and the audio matches perfectly.

The kicker is that if I want to watch the "unedited all" option in mplayer (which I do for the "quick start" mode), then it needs to be as is...

audio_codec = these_settings['audio_codec'] || 'lavc' # not copy...sniff...or you can't hear cars...as ffmpeg loses it on transfer [?] at least the intermediates you *cannot* hear.

HP with edl (only) seriously fails at the 2 hour mark, even with 5 seconds added, or seems to, at least.

windows media player is able to playback the "fulli" that mplayer gets out of sync on (lavc audio), at least with cars.

mplayer dvd://23 -dvd-device e:\ -edl C:\Users\packrd\AppData\Local\Temp\mplayer.temp.edl
  seems to play with audio in sync always, with cars (now with potter...)

what if you grab with "full" audio...does it make its way back out to the DVD? what does dvd flick do audio wise?

without harddup smplayer got audio video out of sync playing DVD, as well as playing ripped files, however
  when you wrote those to DVD, they seemed to get back in sync. ffmpeg, perhaps, is/was fixing them?

fulli with lavc audio and video: mplayer cannot play it back right, but if it's re-encoded with mencoder first [? or is it ffmpeg?], mplayer
seems to play it fine then. Thin ice here...

if I pull from dvd with -acodec lavc (basically downgrade to stereo), then ffmpeg can extract to avi with sound.
  otherwise (cars only), it lacks sound *only on computer players*

Note that mencoder cannot have an endpos on a dvd. Weird.

Note that dvdflick "appears" to encode correctly even if the size is too big, as in it just encodes it "lossy-y"
  The encoding actually appears to be fairly high quality, that dvd flick does, video wise, at least.

ffmpeg -i bigg.mpg -acodec copy -vcodec copy bigg.reindexffmpeg.mpg

resulted in a sound with no audio

I got bigg trying to combine (mencoder ?) two large files.

I think bigg has honestly messed up audio, no reindexing seems to help it, at all.
