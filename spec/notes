what if you grab with "full" audio...does it make its way back out to the DVD? what does dvd flick do audio wise?

without harddup smplayer got audio video out of sync playing DVD, as well as playing ripped files, however
  when you wrote those to DVD, they seemed to get back in sync. ffmpeg, perhaps, is/was fixing them?

fulli with lavc audio and video: mplayer cannot play it back right, but if it's re-encoded with mencoder first [? or is it ffmpeg?], mplayer
seems to play it fine then. Thin ice here...

if I pull from dvd with -acodec lavc (basically downgrade to stereo), then ffmpeg can extract to avi with sound.
  otherwise (cars only), it lacks sound *only on computer players*

Note that mencoder cannot have an endpos on a dvd. Weird.

Note that dvdflick "appears" to encode correctly even if the size is too big, as in it just encodes it "lossy-y"
  The encoding actually appears to be fairly high quality, that dvd flick does, video wise, at least.

ffmpeg -i bigg.mpg -acodec copy -vcodec copy bigg.reindexffmpeg.mpg

resulted in a sound with no audio

I got bigg trying to combine (mencoder ?) two large files.

I think bigg has honestly messed up audio, no reindexing seems to help it, at all.
