MPlayer git-20100211-1-g1c6846f-Kovensky-mt (C) 2000-2009 MPlayer Team
  can play dvd:// and dvdnav:// with seeking at the beginning without crashing...[because old, maybe?]
  mulder's: http://mulder.googlecode.com/files/MPUI.2010-10-17.Full-Package.exe crashes like normal [dvdnav only]
    smplayers seem to always play dvd:// so never crash [?]

the internet seems to "not tell me" if transcode's avisplit is frame accurate or not.

watching a DVD "from the DVD" in smplayer seemed to have the right audio always. yep.
  i.e. transcoding from dvd flick fixed it [probably]

previewing section on HP 2 hours or so and the first thing overlapped the muted section in error...went too long...huh?
  call ffmpeg -i C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -vcodec copy -acodec copy  -ss 7260.0 -t 10.499 C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.1.avi
  call ffmpeg -i C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -vcodec copy -acodec ac3 -vol 0  -ss 7270.5 -t 1.499 C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.2.avi
  call ffmpeg -i C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -vcodec copy -acodec copy  -ss 7272.0 -t 3.999 C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.3.avi

  resulted in sectors of 13.17 1.93, 5.03 instead of 10.5, 1.5, and 4. huh?
   with FFmpeg version SVN-r19313, [BAD VERSION probably]
  call ffmpeg -i C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -vcodec copy -acodec copy  -ss 7260.0 -t 10.499 yo.1.avi
    with r32676 seemed much more sane (!)

$ to fix mplayer out of sync audio:
$ ffmpeg -i HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -target ntsc-dvd -t 1600 yo.mpg
seemed to be as good as adding a harddup via mplayer.  except...umm...VLC can play it right so why can't mplayer?  Hopefully all doesn't matter [?]

ffmpeg "copy copy" on HP fulli seemed to not have audio when that was replayed via mplayer.

monsters inc. overlaps at 25 minutes, 50'ish, 70, "when they land" and there's like 30 'select scenes' (chapters) in that time frame...

bob "they will come" has no mplayer overlap (45 minutes long)

HP 2 "full and edited version" had a twidge off of audio even in VLC (unsure if that was copy or lavc audio)
  seems consistent
  The DVD (flick) burned, then played, appeared to have audio in perfect sync, always.
  seems to play fine in smplayer
  the fulli version was *totally off* in smplayer
  fulli, edited version had some artifacts in VLC
  fulli version had perfect audio in VLC
  audio looks barely off VLC for the whole thing

mplayer (updated) playing dvd:// (bob) can't seek if past 30 minutes or so (pause/hang)

mplayer (updated) playback, if it ever goes off the screen, chokes and hurles and dies (or if it goes under a window that is always on top).

an edl with (updated mplayer and) dvdnav:// (bob) results in a crash when seeking the first few seconds, at least.

Seeking using the "forward 10, back 10" works in mplayer console, 
  also works (!) with smplayer (+10, back 10).
  
Also edl works *perfectly* when playing from the ripped file.

There is only one break in cars DVD. A:3756
  Is it the same in other large DVD's?
  so certainly, mplayer's edl playback is broken currently, for DVD's.

if I change the mute to 2:13, then it works [!], though probably doubly.

"enable dvd menus" in mplayer doesn't seem to help with seeking weirdness in smplayer

smplayer edl against cars DVD *fails* on later ones (1:05), but succeeds on 15:00, mute-wise.
Like epic fail.
also seeking totally fails:
  58 -> 58 works (cars)
  transition to broken seeking:1:02:44
  also always thinks its chapter 1 :)
  
smplayer playing cars fulli (of some sort) seems to be a split second off, audio-wise

smplayer on HP2 -> edited version (ffmpeg through mencoder) with oac copy, is off by an annoying split second when replayed in smplayer
 at other times, it fails everywhere almost, sync-wise
  that "might" have been with HP and -oac lavc, but without harddup.  or maybe it was -oac copy
  VLC plays the audio splendidly on the same.
  plays well from DVD, though.  Just that one file isn't playable with mplayer...
  how does EDL fit into all of this, though?
  also note that mplayer originally couldn't cut right because of audio (with oac copy, I believe)

ffmpeg said that the huge HP grab was always 48 minute duration [?] (then proceeded to work right)

edl *fails* with HP at the 2 hour mark, audio.  The audio did seem to line up, at least, with their lips.
  and if it's video--fails the same. Seems to think it's at second 2678, or minute 44, not minute 120?

smplayer on bob pets pickle and baby has sync'ed audio with oac copy
  in general, if it starts sync'ed, smplayer stays in sync all the way through
  
got av_interleaved_write_frame(): Operation not permitted
  on call ffmpeg -i C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -vcodec copy -acodec copy  -'
;?Pss 749.0 -t 4109.999 C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.5.avi
  then it passed (reading off the "old fulli" with poor audio) when did it again. huh?
  out of disk perhaps??
  
edl works *great* with cars at 15 minutes, and appears to at an hour, too.  Oh, and the audio matches perfectly.

The kicker is that if I want to watch the "unedited all" option in mplayer (which I do for the "quick start" mode), then it needs to be as is...

audio_codec = these_settings['audio_codec'] || 'lavc' # not copy...sniff...or you can't hear cars...as ffmpeg loses it on transfer [?] at least the intermediates you *cannot* hear.

HP with edl (only) seriously fails at the 2 hour mark, even with 5 seconds added, or seems to, at least.

windows media player is able to playback the "fulli" that mplayer gets out of sync on (lavc audio), at least with cars.

mplayer dvd://23 -dvd-device e:\ -edl C:\Users\packrd\AppData\Local\Temp\mplayer.temp.edl
  seems to play with audio in sync always, with cars (now with potter...)

what if you grab with "full" audio...does it make its way back out to the DVD? what does dvd flick do audio wise?

without harddup smplayer got audio video out of sync playing DVD, as well as playing ripped files, however
  when you wrote those to DVD, they seemed to get back in sync. ffmpeg, perhaps, is/was fixing them?

fulli with lavc audio and video: mplayer cannot play it back right, but if it's re-encoded with mencoder first [? or is it ffmpeg?], mplayer
seems to play it fine then. Thin ice here...

if I pull from dvd with -acodec lavc (basically downgrade to stereo), then ffmpeg can extract to avi with sound.
  otherwise (cars only), it lacks sound *only on computer players*

Note that mencoder cannot have an endpos on a dvd. Weird.

Note that dvdflick "appears" to encode correctly even if the size is too big, as in it just encodes it "lossy-y"
  The encoding actually appears to be fairly high quality, that dvd flick does, video wise, at least.

ffmpeg -i bigg.mpg -acodec copy -vcodec copy bigg.reindexffmpeg.mpg

resulted in a sound with no audio

I got bigg trying to combine (mencoder ?) two large files.

I think bigg has honestly messed up audio, no reindexing seems to help it, at all.
