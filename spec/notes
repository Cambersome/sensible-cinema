
VLC: hard crash when ripping that one DVD...long one, about the constitution...

http://forums.thetvdb.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=1726&p=25563#p25563
  seems to imply that their disc id field is useless...not sure they'll be useful to me at all then...

== VLC as a ripper ==

Can't figure out how to use the gui at all, files are always blank or not there? yipes.
Looks like dvdsimple still uses dvdnav so we should be all right with dvdsimple I think.

== ripping sintel ==

thoughts:
  VLC cuts off a bit at the end, it appears
  mencoder seems a bit trippy, also cuts off the end [?] huh?

handbrake has "inconsistent" output (timings seem fine, however, huh?)

vlc Sintel.handbrake.m4v
  14:33 "voice"
  15:02 total, got to the "real" end

using mencoder for raw copying seems...to not work so well.  Maybe it was warning me how cruddy it is.
  it's either mplayer or VLC uh guess. I think.

vlc dvdsimple.1
  avidemux:
    26607 frames
    sum 14:47.787 [bizarre]
    sound is on

  vlc to play:
    no timing info, seems to go through to the end

  1 duplicate frames(s)!
  Post: 321.7s 1000f... [normal status line]

  at least it says "success" at the end yipes. Yiperipers mencoder.

mencoder.dvd when replayed with WMP had messed up audio, same with mencoder.dvdnav

mplayer dvd played fine with WMP

sintel has 3F2R/LFE audio

dvdout.mencoder.straight-copy.dvd
  avidemux ends too early 13:26 huh?
    switching to 24fps doesn't help...
    24180 frames
    audio is in perfect sync
    avidemux doesn't show as much of the end as VLC does huh?
  in VLC has no sound at the end ** loses end **
    ends early still, just cuts out at 14:47
    "your voice" at 14:33

    audio is absolutely off
  VLC
    audio is on
    total 14:47 (complete ?)
    your voice 14:33
    what the....it's on but then too short but it's not?
      guess is it's "ok" but indexed poorly somehow...
      this is ridiculous    

maybe I need to reindex them or something?

mplayer rip's seem to be md5 consistent, with dvd and dvdnav (and slightly different)

== timing dvd player time versus clock time: ==

at 1:44:00 or so I seemed about 6s ahead. yup yup.
  at end, I had like 1:53:20'ish'ish [?] (ok probably like 1:53:11 but who knows for sure :P)

appears that 29.97 is closer to "wall clock time" and DVD players tell you 1:00:00 when it has taken you 1:00:04 in reality.
  at 1:00:00 wristwatch was about 4s ahead

== using handbrake's file for splitting ==

using ffmpeg/mencoder against handbrake, they seemed to be a few seconds forward I think...sigh...
  TODO figure out how to use handbrake, if I ever need to <sigh> it's almost user friendly, dang!
  TODO try the parsers on the...handbrake fella somehow? avidemux?
  maybe convert to mpeg or something +- GOP 1
  maybe handbrake is "reading my mind" time-wise and inserting 30fps timestamps on each frame?
  
mplayer1 to play mencoder.dvdout.8.mpg had timing that was totally wrong/unseekable
mencoder.dvdoutmplayer.mpg was unseekable in avidemux
[-5,5]
1.301 for change of scene for ffmpegdvdout.8.mpeg, ffmpegdvdoutmplayer.mpg
2.102 for change of scene ffmpeg.mencoder.dvdoutmplayer.mpg

that looks like an odd difference.  Except maybe they went in different directions searching for an iframe...

handbrake -> ffmpeg I think sameq -> ffmpeg split
  avidemux:
    1.96
    same with same file split again...hmm...at least it's consistent...
  vlc:
    no audio
  mplayer:
    I o[o]nce was lost

handbrake -> ffmpeg I think sameq -> mencoder split
  audio is the beginning LOL
  avidemux
    2.04 [pretty close...interesting]

== blu sub versus dvd ==

865
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:48,864
… we have…

866
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,325
… dragons.


dvd subs:

869
01:28:47,602 --> 01:28:49,126
<i>...we have...</i>

870
01:28:50,205 --> 01:28:51,604
<i>...dragons.</i>

0.3 off?

how to train dragon DVD srt right on with mplayer DVD 29.97

== mplayer dvdnav  ==

mplayer os x extended has the same "where am I?" on this DVD problem mplayer has.

monsters' inc. plays fine with CCCP+WMP in XP.  No 'where am I?' syndrome.

== avidemux on ripped files ==

avidemux barely off lips:
  mencoder -forceidx -oac copy -ovc copy  dvdoutmplayer.mpg -o yo3.mpg is unseekable
  ffmpeg -i dvdoutmplayer.mpg -sameq yo.mpg took forever, grabbed wrong audio track :P

avidemux from "normal" rips are still off frame-rate wise somehow...

  "wretch" and "me" were visually on, WMP, VLC, VLC on a VLC grab was either on or really really close, mplayer is right on with the DVD

  handbrake file:
    segfault

avidemux on dvdoutmplayer.mpg
  sound right on 1:00:00 wa[a]s lost, looks good.

avidemux on mplayer grab:
  sound ok, lips off
    
avidemux on VLC grab:
  1:00:00 "once wa[a]s lost" audio, video appears messed up lips [looks like they are really grabbing raw data]

== DVD player versus PC player various times ==

DVD player conclusions:
  VLC's are all pretty consistent
  VLC DVD playback can be up to at least 30s off [!]
  mplayers are at the 29.97 offset
    I think mplayer.exe's are pretty consistent
    smplayer?
  WMP is pretty close, but internally inconsistent by some odd
  powerdvd is pretty close but internally inconsistent by some odd
  mplayer grab seems right on [played back with VLC]
  VLC grabs it fine
  WMP on handbrake is 29.97

speeds: ffmpeg: vertex 2 SSD: 105MB/s old HD desktop 58 MB/s

I wonder if mplayer is just a little bit ahead, or internally inconsistent based on poor seeking for GOP's or some odd...it's either right ahead or right on?

appears smplayer is "like a second" or something behind mplayer, and mplayer doesn't quite agree with VLC but is pretty close, and mplayer.exe seems internally consistent.

are all windows GUI wrapper players internally inconsistent, except maybe VLC which is still itself "a tidge off"?

OSOH:



  windows movie maker, dvdout.8.vlc.mpg
    1:00:00 sweet that sound that [s]aved a wretch
    kinder close to VLC...


  VLC on OSOH-handbrake.ffmpeg.full.avi
    1:00:00 is smoking "up" apex [which looks like "wa[a]s" lost actually...hmm...]
    
  AviDemux on OSOH-handbrake.ffmpeg.full.avi
    1:00:00 saved a wretch [like] me (audio is off)
      video is smoking "up" apex [right] 

  avidemux on OSOH-handbrake.ffmpeg.fulli.avi
    1:00:00
      video is like 20s back, grabbing beer
      audio "in the name of the"

  mplayer.exe2 dvdoutmplayer.mpg:
    1:00:00 I once [w]as lost but now

  some mplayer.exe's may have been  Sherpya-SVN-r33216-4.2.5
    versus Sherpya-SVN-r30369-4.2.5 for smplayer
    they seem pretty close though...

    smplayer's mplayer.exe on mplayer file:
    1:00:00 I once [w]as lost but now

  smplayer's mplayer.exe on VLC file:
    unknown timing (no times), but lips are in sync
    
  smplayer's mplayer.exe DVD:
    1:00:00 I was wa[a]s lost like perfect --- I was w[a]as lost -- I once [wa]as lost like every time the w, or just right after it... 3/4 of the way through the w

  WMP on handbrake:
    1:00:00 I was wa[a]s lost

  WMP on VLC file:
    1:00:00 that saved a [wr]etch like me --- that save[d] a wretch like me [huh? it's guessing, like VLC does?]

  WMP on mplayer file:
    cannot seek

  smplayer DVD
    1:00:00 once was [lo]st

  smplayer playing VLC grab:
    lips are in sync 
    searching is "odd"
    1:00:00 once was [l]ost --- once was []lost --- once wa[s] lost
    
  mplayer.exe playing any VLC grab:
    the timing are all messed up, starting at 47453, but it appeared to be right one somewhere "once was lost"

  the mplayer grab can be frame accurate, with matching md5's (I think it's actually mpg) dvdoutmplayer1.avi  dvdoutmplayer.mpg
    87402c45126207884bacc46e6f681722

  vlc grab appears to have the exact same file size, different md5sum's [!] dvdout.vlc3.mpg  vlcdvdout2.mpg
    1b32659b94ea01b45e2860809db49539 *dvdout.7.mpg vlc
    eb4ff70f8bfb1147294d218242492322 *dvdout.8.mpg vlc
    bdcfadd21f09de4de011694af75b67cd *dvdout.vlc3.mpg # they seem to all work fine...
    same sizes though...

    05/16/2011  03:16 AM     6,890,419,584 vlcdvdout2.mpg
    
    
  vlc doesn't have timing replay info for dvdout.9.mpg (its own grab) just approximates
  
  dvdoutmplayer2 seems corrupt (garbled, too short, green)
  
  WMP dvdoutmplayer1.avi works (doesn't know how to seek), VLC works 29.97

  smplayer from dvdoutmplayer1.avi:
      1:00:00 once was [l]ost  --- once was []lost (because of smplayer?)
      seeks fine

  VLC from mplayer grab:
    1:00:00 once wa[a]s lost 
    
  VLC reading OSOH from handbrake m4v:
    1:00:00 I once w[a]s lost but now --- I once [w]as lost but now am found -- I once wa[a]s lost
       [pretty close to 29.97, maybe within GUI incosistency consistency]
    1:53:11 sum [?] (accurate with mplayer!)
  
  VLC reading OSOH from handbrake m4v after an "oac straight copy" from ffmpeg:
    I once wa[a]s lost
  
  smplayer from DVDD:
      1:00:00 I once was [l]ost but now

  avidemux reading OSOH from mplayer grab, also from vlc grab:
    1:00:00 accurate wa[a]s lost audio, video way off LOL
      copy and paste also inaccurate <sigh>
  
  avidemux reading OSOH from handbrake:
    1:00:00 accurate wa[a]s lost
      
  ffmpeg reading OSOH from handbrake m4v:
    1:00:00 I once [was] lost but now (no audio though but looks like it would be...)
    
  VLC reading dvdoutmplayer.mpg, handbrake m4v:
      1:00:00 accurate wa[a]s lost

 All DVD's below this:

  Mac's DVD Player total:
    1:53:04 (almost 5 I think) [barely shows 5 at the beginning]

     total: 6791.6 1:53:11.6

      other "normal DVD player" this is at about my 3604.7
  VLC mac:
    at beginning, seemed to think it had 1:53:05 left negative
    sum: 1:53:04 but it seemed to be cheating...I think it was cheating near the end, too :P
    1:00:00 saved a wret[ch] like me

    1:00:00 that saved a wretch like me, I once [w]as lost
    
  [should be 3.6 off per hour, 6.8 for osoh's sum, is 6.6 'ish :P]
  
  WMP windows 7 DVD:

    1:00:00 once was lost but no[o]w am found
  VLC 7 1.1.9 DVD

MPlayer git-20100211-1-g1c6846f-Kovensky-mt (C) 2000-2009 MPlayer Team
  can play dvd:// and dvdnav:// with seeking at the beginning without crashing...[because old, maybe?]
  mulder's: http://mulder.googlecode.com/files/MPUI.2010-10-17.Full-Package.exe crashes like normal [dvdnav only]
    smplayers seem to always play dvd:// so never crash [?]

the internet seems to "not tell me" if transcode's avisplit is frame accurate or not.

watching a DVD "from the new DVD ISO" in smplayer seemed to have the right audio always. yep.
  i.e. transcoding from dvd flick fixed it [probably]

$ to fix mplayer out of sync audio:
$ ffmpeg -i HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -target ntsc-dvd -t 1600 yo.mpg
seemed to be as good as adding a harddup via mplayer.  except...umm...VLC can play it right so why can't mplayer?  Hopefully all doesn't matter [?]

ffmpeg "copy copy" on HP fulli seemed to not have audio when that was replayed via mplayer.

monsters inc. overlaps at 25 minutes, 50'ish, 70, "when they land" and there's like 30 'select scenes' (chapters) in that time frame...

bob "they will come" has no mplayer overlap (45 minutes long)

HP 2 "full and edited version" had a twidge off of audio even in VLC (unsure if that was copy or lavc audio)
  seems consistent
  The DVD (flick) burned, then played, appeared to have audio in perfect sync, always.
  seems to play fine in smplayer
  the fulli version was *totally off* in smplayer
  fulli, edited version had some artifacts in VLC
  fulli version had perfect audio in VLC
  audio looks barely off VLC for the whole thing

mplayer (updated) playing dvd:// (bob) can't seek if past 30 minutes or so (pause/hang)

mplayer (updated) playback, if it ever goes off the screen, chokes and hurles and dies (or if it goes under a window that is always on top).

an edl with (updated mplayer and) dvdnav:// (bob) results in a crash when seeking the first few seconds, at least.

Seeking using the "forward 10, back 10" works in mplayer console, 
  also works (!) with smplayer (+10, back 10).
  
Also edl works *perfectly* when playing from the ripped file.

There is only one break in cars DVD. A:3756
  Is it the same in other large DVD's?
  so certainly, mplayer's edl playback is broken currently, for DVD's.

if I change the mute to 2:13, then it works [!], though probably doubly.

"enable dvd menus" in mplayer doesn't seem to help with seeking weirdness in smplayer

smplayer edl against cars DVD *fails* on later ones (1:05), but succeeds on 15:00, mute-wise.
Like epic fail.
also seeking totally fails:
  58 -> 58 works (cars)
  transition to broken seeking:1:02:44
  also always thinks its chapter 1 :)
  
smplayer playing cars fulli (of some sort) seems to be a split second off, audio-wise

smplayer on HP2 -> edited version (ffmpeg through mencoder) with oac copy, is off by an annoying split second when replayed in smplayer
 at other times, it fails everywhere almost, sync-wise
  that "might" have been with HP and -oac lavc, but without harddup.  or maybe it was -oac copy
  VLC plays the audio splendidly on the same.
  plays well from DVD, though.  Just that one file isn't playable with mplayer...
  how does EDL fit into all of this, though?
  also note that mplayer originally couldn't cut right because of audio (with oac copy, I believe)

ffmpeg said that the huge HP grab was always 48 minute duration [?] (then proceeded to work right)

edl *fails* with HP at the 2 hour mark, audio.  The audio did seem to line up, at least, with their lips.
  and if it's video--fails the same. Seems to think it's at second 2678, or minute 44, not minute 120?

smplayer on bob pets pickle and baby has sync'ed audio with oac copy
  in general, if it starts sync'ed, smplayer stays in sync all the way through
  
got av_interleaved_write_frame(): Operation not permitted
  on call ffmpeg -i C:\HP_AND_THE_CHAMBER_OF_SECRETS_edited_version.fulli_unedited.tmp.mpg -vcodec copy -acodec copy  -'

  then it passed (reading off the "old fulli" with poor audio) when did it again. huh?
  out of disk perhaps??
  
edl works *great* with cars at 15 minutes, and appears to at an hour, too.  Oh, and the audio matches perfectly.

The kicker is that if I want to watch the "unedited all" option in mplayer (which I do for the "quick start" mode), then it needs to be as is...

audio_codec = these_settings['audio_codec'] || 'lavc' # not copy...sniff...or you can't hear cars...as ffmpeg loses it on transfer [?] at least the intermediates you *cannot* hear.

HP with edl (only) seriously fails at the 2 hour mark, even with 5 seconds added, or seems to, at least.

windows media player is able to playback the "fulli" that mplayer gets out of sync on (lavc audio), at least with cars.

mplayer dvd://23 -dvd-device e:\ -edl C:\Users\packrd\AppData\Local\Temp\mplayer.temp.edl
  seems to play with audio in sync always, with cars (now with potter...)

what if you grab with "full" audio...does it make its way back out to the DVD? what does dvd flick do audio wise?

without harddup smplayer got audio video out of sync playing DVD, as well as playing ripped files, however
  when you wrote those to DVD, they seemed to get back in sync. ffmpeg, perhaps, is/was fixing them?

fulli with lavc audio and video: mplayer cannot play it back right, but if it's re-encoded with mencoder first [? or is it ffmpeg?], mplayer
seems to play it fine then. Thin ice here...

if I pull from dvd with -acodec lavc (basically downgrade to stereo), then ffmpeg can extract to avi with sound.
  otherwise (cars only), it lacks sound *only on computer players*

Note that mencoder cannot have an endpos on a dvd. Weird.

Note that dvdflick "appears" to encode correctly even if the size is too big, as in it just encodes it "lossy-y"
  The encoding actually appears to be fairly high quality, that dvd flick does, video wise, at least.

ffmpeg -i bigg.mpg -acodec copy -vcodec copy bigg.reindexffmpeg.mpg

resulted in a sound with no audio

I got bigg trying to combine (mencoder ?) two large files.

I think bigg has honestly messed up audio, no reindexing seems to help it, at all.
