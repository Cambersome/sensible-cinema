<h1>Upconverting Software DVD/Video Player</h1>
<pre>
      Sensible Cinema can playback your DVD's or Movie files in upscaled goodness.  This means they look
      awesome on higher resolution monitors and it really brings out the details in the movie.
      
      You can use this to play it back in high-res on your monitor, or attach your computer to your projector
      or TV to get back the equivalent of a hardware "DVD upscaler" playback, but for free, no extra
      hardware necessary.

      How:

      1) installation: download the latest version from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sensible-cinema/files">http://sourceforge.net/projects/sensible-cinema/files</a>.  
         Note that you must accept the terms of the gplv3 in order to use this software.
      2) unzip it
      3) run "advanced--upconverter.bat" file
      4) click setup upconverting options button, choose "DVD style playback"
      5) close the setup window, insert DVD, click "watch DVD upconverted (unedited)" button
   
      Enjoy your film.  Feedback welcome rogerdpack@gmail.com

      How does it do this?  It uses a high quality software upscaling algorithm (lanczos)
      along with some denoise and sharpening filters, via ffmpeg/mplayer programs.
      This is (arguably) better than some hardware DVD upscalers.  It's still a work in progress
      but seems to be working well.
