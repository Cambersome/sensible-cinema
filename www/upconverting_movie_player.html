<h1>Upconverting Software DVD/Video/Online Player</h1>
<pre>
      Sensible Cinema can playback your DVD's or Movie files (or even online players) in upscaled goodness.  This means they look
      awesome on higher resolution monitors and it really brings out the details in the movie.
      
      You can use this to play it back in high-res on your monitor, or attach your computer to your projector
      or TV to get back the equivalent of a hardware "DVD upscaler" playback, but for free, no extra
      hardware necessary.

      How:

      1) installation: download the latest version from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sensible-cinema/downloads/list">here</a>.  
         Note that you must accept the terms of the gplv3 in order to use this software.
      2) unzip it
      3) run "advanced--upconverter.bat" file
      4) click setup upconverting options button, choose "DVD style playback"
      5) close the setup window, insert DVD if desired, click "watch DVD upconverted (unedited)" button
      
      to use the "online upconverting" you need to (be using windows and) install https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free
        then use its start menu -> Screen Capture Recorder -> configure -> configure by resizing a transparent window to "overlay" your player
        in one monitor with it so that it will capture that.
        Then run "advanced--upconverter"
        Then click "watch upconverted online player" and drag your window to your other monitor and enjoy upconverted netflix instant/hulu etc.
   
      Enjoy your film.  Feedback welcome rogerdpack@gmail.com

      How does it do this?  It uses a high quality software upscaling algorithm (lanczos)
      along with some denoise and sharpening filters, via ffmpeg/mplayer programs.
      This is (arguably) better than some hardware DVD upscalers.  It's still a work in progress
      but seems to be working well.  WE NEED HELP if you are a movie or image buff we could use
      help tweaking upconvert parameters to find the best settings (though the default seem to work well).
      
      Also note that you "can" get upconversion from other sources.  You can tweak ffdshow + media player classic
      to display with similar settings, or purchase/use PowerDVD which I think also does something like this.
      This project aims to make the process easier :)
