Welcome to the (work in progress) home page of Sensible Cinema, the video scene skipper/muter.

A description of the program can be found <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/README">here</a>.

<h2 style="margin: 0px;">Download</h2>
Please download (save) the latest version via <a href="releases/latest-sensible-cinema.zip">this link</a>.
After downloading it, unzip it (show in explorer -> right click on the .zip file -> Extract all -> Extract).  
Now open the newly extracted "sensible-cinema-x.x.x" folder,
and run the file "run sensible cinema".
You will be initially prompted to accept the license agreement(s) and also install a few (non included, separate project) dependencies.
Now insert a DVD you own, and then choose from sensible cinema's available options (buttons).
Enjoy!

You can find a list of previous versions <a href="releases">here</a>.

Sensible cinema is currently for windows only, ping me if you want this changed.

If you want to create your own "delete list" for a DVD that doesn't have one yet, 
see the <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/how_to_create_your_own_delete_lists.txt">how to create</a> file for instructions on creating a new delete list. <!-- this is actually a short line -->
Then run the contained file "edit or create sensible cinema delete list files.bat"
