<h1>Sensible Cinema</h1>

<pre>
  Welcome to Sensible Cinema.

  Sensible Cinema has a few parts to it.  Click on the part you're interested in trying:

  1) <a href="content_editor.html">Edited video player</a>
       A free video scene skipper/muter.  Sensible Cinema allows you watch edited movies by applying edit lists (EDL's) 
       (i.e. "mute out" or "cut out" questionable scenes/content) to DVD's or movie files.

  2) <a href="upconverting_movie_player.html">Upconverting software player</a>.
      Sensible Cinema can playback your DVD's or Movie files in upscaled goodness.  This means they look
      awesome on higher resolution monitors and it brings out extra details in the movie and looks better,
      similar to how an upscaling DVD player converts DVD's to high-res, this makes them look better
      on computer monitors, which are already high-rest to begin with.  It can also be used as an upscaling
      player for a TV if you hook your laptop up to it.

  3)  Netflix Instant/online movie playing upconverter
      Sensible Cinema can hopefully soon "upconvert" your Netflix Instant movies as you watch them
      to make them look even better than they started (or hulu, or youtube, or anything).  
      This is a work in progress but is somewhat close.
      Ping me if you'd like to try it out. rogerdpack@gmail.com
