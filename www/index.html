Welcome to the (work in progress) home page of Sensible Cinema, the video scene skipper/muter.

A description of the program can be found in its <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/README">readme</a>.

<h2>Download</h2>
Please download the latest version it from the <a href="releases">releases</a> directory,
the latest version can be found <a href="releases/latest-sensible-cinema.zip">here</a>.
After downloading, unzip it (right click -> Extract all).  
Now open the newly extracted "sensible-cinema-x.x.x" folder,
and run the file "run sensible cinema.bat".
You will be initially prompted to accept the license agreement and also install a few (non included, separate) dependencies.
Now insert a DVD you have, and choose from sensible cinema's available options (buttons).
Enjoy!

Sensible cinema is currently for windows only, ping me if you want this changed.

If you want to create your own "delete list" for a DVD that doesn't have one yet, 
see the <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/how_to_create_your_own_delete_lists.txt">how to create</a> file for instructions on creating a new delete list. <!-- this is actually a short line -->
Then run the contained file "edit or create sensible cinema delete list files.bat"

<h2>Resources</h2>
Source code is available <a href="http://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema">here</a>.  Notes for potential developers are <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/development.txt">here</a>.
