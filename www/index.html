<h1>Sensible Cinema</h1>

<pre>
  Welcome to Sensible Cinema.

  Sensible Cinema has a few parts to it.  Click on the part you're interested in trying:

  1) <a href="content_editor.html">Edited video player</a>
       A free video scene skipper/muter.  Sensible Cinema allows you watch edited movies by applying edit lists (EDL's) 
       (i.e. "mute out" or "cut out" questionable scenes) to DVD's or movie files.

  2) <a href="upconverting_movie_player.html">Upconverting software movie/DVD player</a>.
      Sensible Cinema can playback your DVD's or Movie files in upscaled goodness.  This means they look
      awesome on higher resolution monitors and really bring out the details in the movie.  You should
      try it.  It makes movies look better.

  3)  Netflix Instant/online movie player upconverter
      Sensible Cinema can hopefully eventually playback Netflix Instant movies and make them look even better than
      they started (or hulu, or youtube, or anything).  This is a work in progress but is close.
      Ping me if you'd like to try it.
