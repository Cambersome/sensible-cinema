Welcome to the (work in progress) home page of Sensible Cinema, the DVD scene deleter.

More detail about the program can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/README">README</a>.

<h2>Download</h2>
Please download the latest version it from the <a href="releases">releases</a> directory,
the latest version can be found <a href="releases/latest-sensible-cinema.zip">here</a>.
Unzip it (right click -> Extract all).  
Now open the newly created "sensible-cinema-x.x.x" folder,
and run the contained file "run sensible cinema.bat".
You will be initially prompted to accept the license agreement and also install a few (non included) dependency programs.
Now insert a DVD you have, and choose from sensible cinema's available options.
Enjoy!

Sensible cinema is currently for windows only, ping me if you want this changed.

If you want to create your own "delete list" for a DVD that doesn't have one yet, 
then run the contained file "edit or create sensible cinema delete list files.bat"
See also the <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/how_to_create.txt">how to create</a> file for instructions on creating a delete list.

<h2>Creating your own edited DVD</h2>
If you so desire, you could create an edited DVD from the edited file that sensible cinema gives you.
See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBE4WlUM5Qs">how to create a DVD from a video file in windows</a> <a href="how to create a dvd from a file in windows using dvd flick.avi" >[full size]</a> for a demo of how to use the free <a href="http://www.dvdflick.net/">DVD flick</a> to burn a video file to disk.  See also LICENSE.TXT

Windows DVD Maker might help, too.
