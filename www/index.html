<h1 style="float: left;">Welcome to Sensible Cinema</h1>

  Sensible Cinema (the free awesome video player) has a few aspects to it.  
  Click on the part you're interested in:

  1) <a href="content_editor.html">Edited video player</a>
       A free video scene skipper/muter.  Sensible Cinema allows you watch edited movies by applying edit lists (EDL's) 
       to DVD's or movie files. i.e. "mute out" or "cut out" questionable scenes/content.  
       Click <a href="content_editor.html">here</a> for more detail.

  2) <a href="upconverting_movie_player.html">Upconverting software player</a>.
      Sensible Cinema can playback DVD's or movie files in quality upscaled resolution.  This means they look
      awesome on higher resolution monitors and it brings out extra details in the movie and looks better,
      similar to how an upscaling DVD player plays DVD's on high-res TV's, this makes them look better.
      Works well on computer monitors, which are already high-res to begin with.  It can also be used as an upscaling
      player for a TV if you hook your laptop up to it.

  3)  Netflix Instant/online movie playing upconverter.
      Sensible Cinema can hopefully soon "upconvert" Netflix Instant movies as you watch them
      to make them look even better than they already are (or hulu, or youtube, or whatever).  
      This is a work in progress but is somewhat close.
      Ping me if you'd like to try it out. rogerdpack@gmail.com
