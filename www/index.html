Welcome to the (work in progress) home page of Sensible Cinema, the free video scene skipper/muter.

A description of this program can be found <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/README">here</a>.

<h2 style="margin: 0px;">Download</h2>
Please download (save) the latest version via <a href="releases/latest-sensible-cinema.zip">latest-sensible-cinema.zip</a>.
NB that you want to download from here (latest-sensible-cinema.zip), not from github (source only).
After downloading it, unzip it (show in explorer -> right click on the .zip file -> Extract all -> Extract).  
Now open the newly extracted "sensible-cinema-x.x.x" folder,
and run the file "run sensible cinema.bat".
You will be initially prompted to accept the license agreement(s) and also install a few (non included, separate project) dependencies.
Now insert a DVD you own, and then choose from sensible cinema's available options (buttons).

You can see the list of the DVD delete lists available <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/tree/master/zamples/edit_decision_lists/dvds">here</a> (all of them created earlier by volunteers like you).  
If yours is there, then you should be good to go.  Enjoy!

If yours isn't there, then we'd ask you to create your own "delete list" for a DVD that doesn't have one yet, 
see the <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/how_to_create_your_own_delete_lists.txt">how to create</a> file for instructions on creating a new delete list. <!-- this is actually a short line -->
Then run the contained file "advanced-edit or create sensible cinema delete list files.bat" to create and edit your file.  
Don't forget to upload your new file back to us when you're done, so others can benefit from your work (see "contact").
