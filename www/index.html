Welcome to the (work in progress) home page of Sensible Cinema, the video scene skipper/muter.

A description of the program can be found <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/README">here</a>.

<h2 style="margin: 0px;">Download</h2>
Please download (save) the latest version via <a href="releases/latest-sensible-cinema.zip">latest-sensible-cinema.zip</a>.
NB that you want to download from here (latest-sensible-cinema.zip), not from github (source only).
After downloading it, unzip it (show in explorer -> right click on the .zip file -> Extract all -> Extract).  
Now open the newly extracted "sensible-cinema-x.x.x" folder,
and run the file "run sensible cinema".
You will be initially prompted to accept the license agreement(s) and also install a few (non included, separate project) dependencies.
Now insert a DVD you own, and then choose from sensible cinema's available options (buttons).

You can see the list of the DVD delete lists available <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/tree/master/zamples/edit_decision_lists/dvds">here</a> (all of them created earlier by volunteers like you).  
If yours is there, then you should be good to go.  Enjoy!

If you want to create your own "delete list" for a DVD that doesn't have one yet, 
see the <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/how_to_create_your_own_delete_lists.txt">how to create</a> file for instructions on creating a new delete list. <!-- this is actually a short line -->
Then run the contained file "edit or create sensible cinema delete list files.bat" to create and edit your file.  Don't forget to
upload it back to us when you're done, so others can benefit from your work.

<h2 style="margin: 0px;">Other Resources</h2>
You can find a list of previous versions <a href="releases">here</a>.
Let me know via the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sensible-cinema?pli=1">google group</a> or email rogerdpack@gmail.com if you have feedback or have any other ideas/suggestions, or just want to say hi.

Source code is available <a href="http://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema">here</a>.  Notes for potential source code developers are <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/development.txt">here</a>.  For (non-techy) contributions, just upload files to the google group.

Sensible cinema is currently for windows only, ping me if you want this changed.
