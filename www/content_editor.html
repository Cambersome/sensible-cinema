<h1>Sensible Cinema Sanitizer</h1></div>
<pre>
Sensible Cinema allows you watch edited movies by applying edit lists (EDL's -- edit decision lists) 
(i.e. "mute out" or "cut out" questionable scenes) to DVD's or movie files.

A description and history/background of sensible-cinema can be found <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/README">here</a>.  
Don't forget to come back to this page to download it, though (from the "Download" section).

<h2 style="margin: 0px;">Download</h2>
To download, please check the checkbox if you agree to the terms of the 
license agreement (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">gplv3</a>) and wish to download and use sensible cinema.  

<input type="checkbox" class="trigger" onClick="$('#comments').toggle(); $('#comments2').toggle();"/>  I have read and agree to the license terms and conditions.

<div id="comments" style="display:none;  border-style:dotted; border-width:1px; border-color: #aaaaaa; padding: 5px;"> 
  Please download the latest version of sensible cinema from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/sensible-cinema/files/">sourceforge</a>.  You can also see the <a href="source">source</a>.
</div>
After download, unzip it.  For windows users, that's like: 
   Reveal the file in explorer -> right click on the file -> Extract all -> Extract.  
Now open the newly created sensible-cinema-x.x.x folder, and run the file "run sensible cinema.bat"
You will be initially prompted to accept the license agreement(s) and also install a few 
(non included, separate ownership/distribution) dependencies.
Now insert a DVD you own, and restart sensible cinema to see available options.
Note that you want to download from sourceforge not from github.com (github is just the raw source).
There is more usage documentation within the "sensible-cinema/documentation" folder contained there.

<h3>Mac user prerequisites</h3>Mac users will need to install some programs first.

If you plan on watching any movies in "realtime" then you'll need to download <a href="http://mplayerx.org/#Download">mplayerx</a>.

If you plan on doing any auto-video editing/saving then you'll need to install <a href="http://www.macports.org/">macports</a>.  
Install macports, then afterward open the "terminal" Application and execute the following command:
$ sudo port install mencoder ffmpeg gocr
After this finishes (it will take awhile) you'll be ready to run Sensible Cinema.
Note that by installing these, you're accepting their respective licenses/distributions.

<h3>Upconverting/upscaling DVD/video player</h3>Sensible Cinema comes with its own upscaling/upconverting software DVD/movie file player. See it and the various other things that sensible cinema does <a href="..">here</a>.

<h3>Available edited movie lists</h3>You can see the (small) current list of DVD edit lists (EDL's) thus far available <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/tree/master/zamples/edit_decision_lists/dvds">here</a> (all of them created previously by volunteers like you).  
If yours is already there, then you might be good to go.  Just use it.

If yours isn't there, then we'd ask you to help us by creating and submitting your own EDL (delete/cut list) for your DVD that doesn't have one yet, 
see the <a href="https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/documentation">how to create</a> file for instructions on creating a new delete list. <!-- this is actually a short line -->
Then run the file "advanced-edit or create sensible cinema delete list files.bat" to create and edit your new delete list.  Sensible Cinema has a few things to help you there.
Don't forget to upload your new file back to us when you're done, so others can benefit from your work (see "contact", below).

That link is the full list--your help is wanted/needed to help it grow!
