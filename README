This is a program that allows you to "mute out" or "bleep out" arbitrary scenes during movie playback.
It aims to allow this on any arbitrary player, including online movie players.

It takes as input a list of known "skip-worthy" scenes (profanity, et al), 
tracks the player as it is playing, then mutes or blanks out the system screen appropriately, during those scenes.

Currently it works for hulu and VLC on windows.  It also isn't hard to add new player specs (thanks Ruby!), 
and probably wouldn't be super hard to add more operating systems.

== How to use ==

Start playing your movie in its player, then startup sensible-cinema thus:

C:\> jruby -S sensible-cinema mute_list.yml player_description.yml

It then runs sensible-cinema within your console window, using screen tracking to monitor the playback position.
It is presumed that you'll minimize the console window and enjoy the movie.

Here's an example would be watching the "cars" DVD using VLC full-screened:

C:\> jruby -S sensible-cinema disney_cars.yml D:/installs/jruby-1.5.1/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/sensible-cinema-0.6.0/zamples/players/vlc_full_screened_over_hour.yml

(Run --help to see available player list)

C:\> jruby -S sensible-cinema --help

== How to install ==

$ jruby -S gem install sensible-cinema 

  it's jruby only currently (since jruby allows for proper thread concurrency, and feels like the only sane ruby for windows).
  Get it first from http://jruby.org.  It could theoretically be ported to MRI 1.9.x, if anybody wants to.
  It's also currently windows only, though it shouldn't be too much work to support other OS's, and I'd be happy to if interest
  developed.  I'm somewhat targeting Netflix online streaming, hence the focus being on windows thus far.
  
== FAQ ==

Q. Can I watch these movies on my TV, not on my computer?

A. Not yet. Currently you'll either need to attach your computer to your TV (buy some long cables, or a new graphics card, etc.)
   or get a laptop you can then use as an HTPC (ex: buy a used older one), and/or request I do a linux port if you laptop doesn't come
   with windows pre-installed.

   There is also some work developing toward getting the stuff to stream live to your wii/ps3/xbox from windows.
   github message me if you're interested in trying it out.
