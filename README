Sensible-cinema (also known as "paranoid cinema" [inside joke] ) is a program that allows you to apply 
programmed edit lists (Edit Decision Lists [2]) to DVD's.
I.e. you can edit a DVD to "mute out" or "bleep out" scenes, or skip them.

It is essentially a linear editor [1] that applies Edit Decision Lists [2] to videos, by wrapping
a few freely available open source (GPL) programs [3] (VLC Media Player, Mplayer/mencoder, ffmpeg et al)
to accomplish the editing.

To use it, basically install then run it (see below).
It will come up with some windows where you choose what you want to do
(edit an edit list, use an edit decision list to edit a DVD, etc.)

If you try to make an edited copy of your DVD, note that it will take about one and a half times
as long as the playtime of the movie itself, so budget some time for it.

Enjoy!

== Installation ==

To install, download the latest .zip versioned file from: http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema/
then unzip it (right click -> Extract all)
then "click into it" and search for and run the file "run sensible cinema.bat"

== Creating Your Own Edit Lists, or modifying previously existing ones ==

You create an edit decision list for sensible cinema to use against whatever you want.

An Edit Decision List looks something like this example:

Here's one with more detail

https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/zamples/edit_decision_lists/example_edit_decision_list.txt

Basically your job is to create an appropriate file (like that one) somewhere, 
then start sensible-cinema and instruct it to use your new file.

Once you're done then you can contribute your scene descriptions file if desired, back to the project itself (see the "feedback" section,
below).

== FAQ ==

Q. How do I watch these on my TV, not just on my computer?
A. You could burn a new DVD with it.  First create it on your hard drive.  Then use some burning utility.
  Dvd Flick is a good one for windows.  Heere's a screencast of using it: http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema
  For OS X : iDVD might work well.
  You might be able to move your laptop over to near your TV and hook it in from there.  
  Or buy a very long cord and plug it in as an extra monitor from your desktop.
  If you're interested in also being able to "beam" it from your computer to your game console (ex: PS3) ping me--I might have 
  something in mind that could help, though hasn't been created yet.

== Caveats ==

NB that "someone" has to create a edit decision lists, per DVD.
If one doesn't yet exist for the DVD you want edited,
you could employ somebody to create it, or create it yourself.  Make sure to submit it
back to us when you're done, so that everyone can benefit from it.
Fortunately only one person has to do it, once, for everybody to benefit, and the editing process is fairly easy.

Also note that if your DVD has scratches that cause it to skip, the time signatures will be off, so clean your discs!

== Motivation ==

The initial motivation for the project was that I dislike profanity in movies.
It's jarring, if you're not used to it in real life.
Also sometimes certain scenes in movies offend, and don't contribute to the overall plot,
and I'd rather not watch a movie that has them.
Clearplay (a realtime filtering DVD player)
(for me) didn't cut it.  It costs (I'm too cheap to pay--and many
many other people don't/can't use it...).  Their
filters sometimes don't cut out all unwanted content (ex: Saints and
Soldiers left profanity in its filtered version...which wasn't what I had
anticipated.  Others have noted that sometimes the edit timings
are off so that it will mute out sections just previous to the profanity, while
leaving the profanity in, etc.).  Also clearplay apparently runs a rather 
confusing subscription policy, as well, so I'm told [1].
Also sometimes clearplay "mutes out" profanity but you can easily still lip read it,
so it's almost as if you were exposed to it anyway.  Not ideal.
There is no little community collaboration/review.
They don't even have a "request a filter" option anymore.
They don't have filters for movies that I want edited (Condorman and Tron
lacked last time I checked...probably because they are too
obscure.) Also I watch movies only on computer, and they no
longer have a computer player.  They also don't edit streamed
online movies either (last time I checked, anyway).  So overall I
wanted to build my own that overcame some of these hurdles and was
also more accessible/open.

I also wanted to get a prototype out there of some ideas so that
people can't patent them and pretend that they were inventors :)

So the project started off as a prototype that could "watch hulu (online) movies
edited" (it uses screen tracking and OCR's the on-screen
timestamp, monitors it for specific times, and reacts appropriately).
However, I do not currently release that version to the public for patent
reasons (clearplay has a patent on realtime tracking,
which is similar).  I have released older versions that do, but not
anymore.
Then I realized I could basically have the same effect by using
pre-processing and Edit Decision Lists (basically by using playlists with
VLC, to play from second x to y, then from x to mu, etc.).
I just pass in a playlist, it does all the work for me.
There are a few released versions that do this exactly.
Then it occurred to me that you could grab the several clean segments
off a DVD, and piece them together to create an edited copy.  This avoids 
realtime tracking.  Which is where we are now.

== Troubleshooting ==

Note that you'll need java previously installed for this to work.  You probably already do though.
If you run into a snag, try cleaning your DVD. Baking soda toothpaste might help.
If it still errs, report it to the authors, along with a screen snapshot and steps of
how to reproduce the problem, preferably.  See feedback section.

If it says "audio problem try pcm" then you can add
"audio_codec" => "lavc"
to your EDL and try again.

Also if your DVD playback has no audio, try the "lavc" setting, above.  And report it (see feedback).
