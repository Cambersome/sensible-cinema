Sensible-cinema is a program that allows you to do pre-programmed edit decision lists (i.e. "mute out" 
or "bleep out" scene lists) for DVD's.
An experimental player also works on arbitrary media players like netflix online, vlc, hulu, etc.

To install: 

download the latest .zip version file from: http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema/
unzip it
"go into it" and run the file "run sensible cinema.bat" from within it.
Note that you'll need java previously installed for it to work, but chances are you already have it.

== Programming Your Own List ==

To program sensible-cinema, you create an edit decision list for it to use.

An Edit Decision List looks something like this example:

Here's one with more detail

https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/zamples/edit_decision_lists/example_edit_decision_list.txt

Basically your job is to create an appropriate file (like that one) somewhere, 
then start sensible-cinema and instruct it to use your new file.

Once you're done then you can contribute your scene descriptions file if desired, back to the project itself [1].

== FAQ ==

Q. How do I watch these on my TV?
A. You can burn a DVD with it.  First create it on your hard drive.  Then use
  Dvd Flick ()a good one for windows) (here's a screencast of using it within http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema)
  For OS X : iDVD might work well.
  You could also drag your laptop over to your TV and hook it in that way.
  If you're interested in being able to "beam" it from your computer to your game console (ex: PS3) ping me--I might have something in mind.

== Caveats ==

NB that "someone" will have to create a scene descriptions list, per DVD/online movie.
Unless it already exists, then "someone" already has, so you don't have to.  Fortunately
only one person has to do it, once, for everybody to benefit, and the editing process is fairly easy.
You can employ somebody to do it, or do it yourself, then submit it.

The concept isn't too novel.  Some examples:

Edited "airplane edit" style movies.
Commercial TV (ABC, NBC) show their own (edited) movies at times.
Clean Flicks (used to) sell edited movies
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_video_editing
http://imdb.com tends to have reasonably good lists of what occurs in movies (find a movie, click on "parent's guide" on the left).  Sometimes it even lists the time signatures for events (ex: "Labyrinth" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/parentalguide) which you could use to translate into a sensible-cinema compatible list.
Normal movies versus "directors cut unedited" movies (one is sometimes preferable)
