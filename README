This is a program that allows you to "mute out" or "bleep out" bad scenes in movie playback.
It aims to allow this flexibility on any arbitrary player, including online movie players.

It takes a list of known "skip-worthy" scenes (profanity, et al), 
tracks the player as it is playing, then mutes or blanks out the system screen appropriately, during those scenes.

Currently it works for hulu, VLC on windows.  It also isn't hard to add new players, and probably isn't super hard to add
more operating systems.

== How to use ==

Start playing your movie, then

C:\> jruby -S sensible-cinema mute_list.yml player_description.yml

run it with --help to see available players:

C:\> jruby -S sensible-cinema --help

an example would be

C:\> jruby -S sensible-cinema disney_cars.yml 

You can find a list of example files at http://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/tree/master/zamples

== How to install ==

$ jruby -S gem install sensible-cinema 

(jruby only for now [since it allows for proper thread concurrency], get it from http://jruby.org)
