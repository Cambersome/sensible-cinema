Sensible-cinema (also known to us as "paranoid cinema" [inside joke ha ha] ) is a program that allows you to apply 
programmed delete lists (i.e. Edit Decision Lists [2]) to DVD's you already own.

I.e. you can edit a DVD to "mute out" or skip certain scenes.

It is essentially a linear editor [1] that applies Edit Decision Lists [2] to videos, by wrapping
a few freely available open source programs [3]
to accomplish the editing for you.  Then you can sit back and relax as you watch the "sensible"
version of your DVD.

To use it, basically install it then run it (see installation, below).
It will come up with some windows where you choose what you want to do

If you try to make a copy of your DVD, note that it will take about one and a half times
as long as the playtime of the movie itself, so budget some time for it.

Also note that just because a video lacks profanity...does not immediately make it an inspiring experience.
I'd suggest carefully evaluating your motives, and going with those.
Sensible cinema does not a clean movie make of a dirty one.  Don't watch it if it's not wholesome! Be nice to yourself!
dove.org is a good reference for discovering the "uplifting" level of movies [4].  And of course sensible cinema does help
a little bit.
Also note that even if you have an edited copy of a DVD floating around, if you have kids, chances are they
will eventually find (and watch) the unedited originals, so be careful there, and do what is needful.

Enjoy your movies!

== Installation ==

To install, download the latest .zip versioned file from: http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema/
then unzip it (right click -> Extract all)
then "click into it" and search for and run the file "run sensible cinema.bat"

== Creating Your Own Delete Lists, or modifying previously existing ones ==

See the accompanied how_to_create.txt file.

== FAQ ==

Q. How do I watch these on my TV, not just on my computer?
A. You could burn a new DVD with it.  First create it on your hard drive.  Then use some burning utility.
  Dvd Flick is a good one for windows.  Heere's a screencast of using it: http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema
  For OS X : iDVD might work well.
  You might be able to move your laptop over to near your TV and hook it in from there.  
  Or buy a very long cord and plug it in as an extra monitor from your desktop.
  If you're interested in also being able to "beam" it from your computer to your game console (ex: PS3) ping me--I might have 
  something in mind that could help, though hasn't been created yet.

Q. I want to give an edited DVD to a friend, how do I do that?
A. Probably give them the original DVD and a link to sensible-cinema :)
   You may want to loan them a DVD burner if they don't have one.

== Caveats ==

NB that "someone" has to create a delete list, per DVD.
If one doesn't yet exist for the DVD you want edited,
you could employ somebody to create it, or create it yourself.  Make sure to submit it
back to us when you're done, so that everyone can benefit from it.
Fortunately only one person has to do it, once, for everybody to benefit, and the editing process is fairly easy.

Also note that if your DVD has scratches that cause it to skip, the time signatures will be off, so clean your discs!

== Motivation ==

The initial motivation for the project was that I dislike profanity in movies.
It's jarring, if you're not used to it in real life.
Also sometimes certain scenes in movies offend, and don't contribute to the overall plot,
and I'd rather not watch a movie that has them.
Clearplay (a realtime filtering DVD player)
(for me) didn't cut it.  It costs (I'm too cheap to pay--and many
many other people don't/can't use it...).  Their
filters sometimes don't cut out all unwanted content (ex: Saints and
Soldiers left profanity in its filtered version...which wasn't what I had
anticipated.  Others have noted that sometimes the edit timings
are off so that it will mute out sections just previous to the profanity, while
leaving the profanity in, etc.).  Also clearplay apparently runs a rather 
confusing subscription policy, as well, so I'm told [1].
Also sometimes clearplay "mutes out" profanity but you can easily still lip read it,
so it's almost as if you were exposed to it anyway.  Not ideal.
There is no little community collaboration/review.
They don't even have a "request a filter" option anymore.
They don't have filters for movies that I want edited (Condorman and Tron
lacked last time I checked...probably because they are too
obscure.) Also I watch movies only on computer, and they no
longer have a computer player.  They also don't edit streamed
online movies either (last time I checked, anyway).  So overall I
wanted to build my own that overcame some of these hurdles and was
also more accessible/open.

I also wanted to get a prototype out there of some ideas so that
people can't patent them and pretend that they were inventors :)

So the project started off as a prototype that could "watch hulu (online) movies
edited" (it uses screen tracking and OCR's the on-screen
timestamp, monitors it for specific times, and reacts appropriately).
However, I do not currently release that version to the public for patent
reasons (clearplay has a patent on realtime tracking,
which is similar).  I have released older versions that do, but not
anymore.
Then I realized I could basically have the same effect by using
pre-processing and Edit Decision Lists (basically by using playlists with
VLC, to play from second x to y, then from x to mu, etc.).
I just pass in a playlist, it does all the work for me.
There are a few released versions that do this exactly.
Then it occurred to me that you could grab the several clean segments
off a DVD, and piece them together to create an edited copy.  This avoids 
realtime tracking.  Which is where we are now.

== Troubleshooting ==

Note that you'll need java previously installed for this to work.  You probably already do though.
If you run into a snag, try cleaning your DVD. Baking soda toothpaste might help.
If it still errs, report it to the authors, along with a screen snapshot and steps of
how to reproduce the problem, preferably.  See feedback section.

If it says "audio problem try pcm" then you can add
"audio_codec" => "lavc"
to your EDL and try again.

It can fail also because a deletion is past end of DVD, or 
Also note that if your DVD has scratches that cause it to skip, the time signatures will be off after that point, 
so clean your discs and try again!

Also you could try a different computer (desktop computers' DVD drives seem to work better at times than laptops')

Too slow? One big speedup would be getting a faster hard drive (like an SSD).  A second might be to get a faster DVD drive.
  I'm not certain but I don't believe that a faster cpu (or even dual core, etc.), will currently help much, 
  though it might like 3% or something.
