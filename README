Sensible-cinema (also known to us as "paranoid cinema" [inside joke ha ha] ) is a program that allows you to apply 
programmed delete lists (i.e. Edit Decision Lists [2]) to DVD's you already own.

I.e. you can edit a DVD to "mute out" or skip certain scenes.

It is essentially a linear editor [1] that applies Edit Decision Lists [2] to videos, by wrapping
a few freely available open source programs [3]
to accomplish the editing for you.  Then you can sit back and relax as you watch the "sensible"
version of your DVD.

To use it, basically install it, insert an original DVD that you want to see edited, then run sensible cinema.
It will pop up some windows where you choose what to do for that DVD, hopefully easily.

Note that the whole process can at times take hours, so budget some time for it.

Also note that just because a video lacks profanity...does not immediately make it an inspiring experience.
I'd suggest carefully evaluating your motives, and going with those.
Sensible cinema does not a clean movie make of a dirty one.  Don't watch it if it's not wholesome! Be nice to yourself!
dove.org is a good reference for discovering the "uplifting" level of movies [4].  And of course sensible cinema does help
a little bit.
Also note that even if you have an edited copy of a DVD floating around, if you have kids, chances are they
will eventually find (and watch) the unedited originals, so be careful there, and do what is needful.

Enjoy your movies!

== Installation ==

To install, download the latest .zip versioned file from: http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema/
then unzip it (right click -> Extract all)
then "click into it" and search for and run the file "run sensible cinema.bat"

== Creating Your Own Delete Lists, or modifying previously existing ones ==

See the accompanied how_to_create.txt file.

== FAQ ==

Q. How do I watch these on my TV, not just on my computer?
A. You could burn a new DVD with it.  First create it on your hard drive.  Then use some burning utility.
  Dvd Flick is a good one for windows.  There's a screencast of using it within: http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema
  DeVeDe almost might work for windows users: http://www.majorsilence.com/devede though it looks less user friendly.
  For OS X : iDVD might work well.
  You might be able to move your laptop over to near your TV and hook it in from there.  
  Or buy a very long cord and plug it in as an extra monitor from your desktop.
  If you're interested in also being able to "beam" it from your computer to your game console (ex: PS3) ping me--I might have 
  something in mind that could help, though hasn't been created yet.

Q. I want to give an edited DVD to a friend, how do I do that?
A. Probably give them the original DVD and a link to sensible-cinema :)
   You may want to loan them a DVD burner if they don't have one.

== Caveats ==

NB that "someone" has to create a delete list, per DVD.
If one doesn't yet exist for the DVD you want edited,
you could employ somebody to create it, or create it yourself.  Make sure to submit it
back to us when you're done, so that everyone can benefit from it.
Fortunately only one person has to do it, once, for everybody to benefit, and the editing process is fairly easy.

Also note that if your DVD has scratches that cause it to skip, the time signatures will be off, so clean your discs!

== Motivation ==

The initial motivation for the project was that I dislike deity profanity in movies.
And reall any profanity is jarring, if you're not used to it in real life, and can
make you a bit on edge when you watch a movie.
Also sometimes only certain scenes in movies offend, and don't contribute to the overall plot,
and I'd rather not watch a movie that has them.  But I still want to be able to watch movies at all :)
I tried Clearplay (a realtime filtering DVD player)
but (for me) it didn't seem to cut it.  It costs money (I'm too cheap to pay--and many
many other people don't/can't use it...).  Their
filters sometimes don't cut out all unwanted content (ex: Saints and
Soldiers left profanity in its filtered version...which wasn't what I had
anticipated.  Others have noted that sometimes the edit timings
are slightly off so that it will mute out sections just previous to profanity, while
leaving the profanity itself in, etc.).  Clearplay apparently also runs a rather 
confusing subscription policy, as well, I'm told [1].
Clearplay also has little community collaboration/review (though they do have some feedback).
They don't even have a "request a filter" option anymore, like they used to.
They also don't have filters for all the movies that I want to see edited (Condorman and Tron
lacked last time I checked were lacking...probably because they are too
obscure.) Also I watch movies only on computer, and they
have no computer filter player, only DVD players.  They also don't edit streamed
online movies either (last time I checked, anyway).  So overall I
wanted to build my own that overcame some of these hurdles and was
also more accessible/open.

I also wanted to get a prototype out there of some of my ideas so that
others can't patent them and pretend that they were inventors :)

So originally the project started off as a prototype that could "watch hulu (online) and netflix instant movies
edited" (it uses screen tracking and OCR's the on-screen
timestamp, monitors it for specific times, and reacts appropriately).
However, this functionality, though working, is disabled for patent
reasons (clearplay has a patent on realtime tracking).  
Some older released versions had it enabled, but not anymore.
Then I realized I could basically create the same effect using
(more patent friendly) pre-processing and deletion lists (basically 
Edit Decision Lists enforced using playlists for
VLC, like play from second x to y, then from x to mu, etc.).
I just pass in a playlist, it does all the work for me.
There are a few released versions that do this exactly.
Then it occurred to me that you could grab the several clean segments
off a DVD, and piece them together to create an edited copy.  This avoids 
realtime tracking.  This seems reasonably patent friendly, so it is
what I release here.

== Troubleshooting ==

Note that you'll need java previously installed for this to work.  You probably already do though.
If you run into a snag, it might have failed in "grabbing" the DVD, and only got part of it.
Try cleaning your DVD and starting over (delete all files, start again). 
Baking soda toothpaste might help with cleaning it.
If it still errs, report it, along with a screen snapshot and steps of
how to reproduce the problem, preferably.  See feedback section.

It can fail also because a deletion is past end of DVD, or 
Also note that if your DVD has scratches that cause it to skip, the time signatures will be off after that point, 
so clean your discs and try again!

Also make sure you aren't out of disk space.

Also you could try a different computer (desktop computers' DVD drives seem to work better at times than laptops')

Also (for power users) make sure your version of ffmpeg is relatively new, as older versions (r19313) is known to crop wrong.
If you don't know what this means then you're probably ok and don't have to worry about it.

Too slow? One big speedup would be getting a faster hard drive (SSD perhaps, though
  sensible cinema mostly reads large files, so a speedy spinning disk might 
  be just as fast, except for high end SSD's).  A second help might be to get a faster DVD drive.
  Another option is to watch it in the realtime option.
  A faster disk drive might help, too, though that's a bit more rare to upgrade, and they all
  seem to be the same speed to me (about 60 fps).
  I'm not certain but I don't believe that a faster cpu (or even dual core, etc.), will help much, 
  though it might like 3% or something.  It might help for the burning to disk phase, though.
  Also ping me if you think it's too slow and I'll see what I can do.
