Sensible-cinema is a program that allows you to apply pre-programmed edit decision lists (i.e. "mute out" 
or "bleep out" scene lists or skip scenes) for DVD's.

An experimental player also works on arbitrary media players like netflix online, vlc, hulu, etc, but is currently disabled.

It is basically a linear editor [1] that applies Edit Decision Lists [2] to videos, by wrapping
a few freely available open source (GPL) programs [2] (VLC Media Player, mplayer/mencoder, ffmpeg).

To use it, basically install it, then run it. It will come up with some windows where you choose what you want to do
(edit a list, apply an edit decision list to a DVD, etc.)

== Installation ==

download the latest .zip version file from: http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema/
unzip it (right click -> Extract all)
"click into it" and search for then run the file "run sensible cinema.bat"

Note that you'll need java previously installed for it to work, but chances are you already have it.

== Creating Your Own List ==

You create an edit decision list for sensible cinema to use against whatever you want.

An Edit Decision List looks something like this example:

Here's one with more detail

https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/zamples/edit_decision_lists/example_edit_decision_list.txt

Basically your job is to create an appropriate file (like that one) somewhere, 
then start sensible-cinema and instruct it to use your new file.

Once you're done then you can contribute your scene descriptions file if desired, back to the project itself [1].

== FAQ ==

Q. How do I watch these on my TV?
A. You can burn a DVD with it.  First create it on your hard drive.  Then use
  Dvd Flick ()a good one for windows) (here's a screencast of using it within http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema)
  For OS X : iDVD might work well.
  You could also drag your laptop over to your TV and hook it in that way.  Or buy a very long cord and plug it in as an extra monitor.
  If you're interested in also being able to "beam" it from your computer to your game console (ex: PS3) ping me--I might have 
  something in mind that could eventually help.

== Caveats ==

NB that "someone" has to create a edit decision lists, per DVD.
If one doesn't yet exist for the DVD you want edited,
you could employ somebody to create it, or create it yourself.  Make sure to submit it
back to us when you're done, so that everyone can benefit from it.
Fortunately only one person has to do it, once, for everybody to benefit, and the editing process is fairly easy.

== License ==

See the included LICENSE file for licensing, usage terms (basically gplv3 for all the source).
Some other programs are (distributed separately and) called by this one, typically under the gplv2.

http://imdb.com tends to have reasonably good lists of what occurs in movies (find a movie, click on "parent's guide" on the left).  Sometimes it even lists the time signatures for events (ex: "Labyrinth" http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091369/parentalguide) which you could use to translate into a sensible-cinema compatible list.
