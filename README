Sensible-cinema (also known to us as "paranoid cinema" [our own inside joke ha ha]) allows you to apply 
pre-programmed delete lists (e.g. Edit Decision Lists [2]) to DVD's you already own.  It is currently in beta,
though will always be free software, even after release.

I.e. you can play or edit a DVD to "mute out" or skip certain scenes.

This allows you to sit back and relax as you watch a more "sensiblized" showing of your DVD.

To use it, basically install, then insert an original DVD that you want to edited, then run sensible cinema.
It will pop up some windows where you choose what to do with that DVD.

You can either watch it edited in realtime from the DVD, or created an edited 
video version of the DVD (an sensibilized video file), on your hard drive.

How? Sensible cinema basically takes the original DVD, slices out the bad parts, then gives you the result.
It is essentially a linear editor [1] that applies Edit Decision Lists [2] to videos.  It wraps
a few freely available open source programs [3] to accomplish the editing for you.
It also has a few "realtime viewing" options available, again based on open source software [3].

Note that the whole process can take several hours, so budget some time for it.

Also note that just because an edited video lacks profanity...does not immediately make it an inspiring experience.
I'd suggest carefully evaluating your motives, and going with those.
Sensible cinema does not a clean movie make of a dirty one.  Don't watch it if it's not wholesome! Be nice to yourself!

dove.org and common sense media are good references for discovering the "uplifting" level of movies [4].  
Also note that even if you have an edited copy of a DVD floating around, if you have kids, chances are they
will eventually find (and watch) the unedited originals, so be careful there, and do what is needed.

Enjoy your movies!

== Installation ==

Instructions available here: http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema
NB that you want to download from there, not from github, and the file you want is called "latest-sensible-cinema.zip"

== Creating Your Own Delete Lists, or modifying the previously existing ones ==

See the accompanied how_to_create_your_own_delete_lists.txt file.

== Creating your own edited DVD ==

I don't know how I've never burned a DVD.
Windows DVD Maker might help, http://www.dvdflick.net might help.
See also LICENSE.TXT for some caveats you should understand first.

== FAQ ==

Q. How do I watch these on my TV, not just on my computer?
A. You also might be able to move a laptop over to near your TV and hook it in from your laptop.
  Or buy a very long monitor cord and plug it in from your desktop/laptop.
  You could also buy a projector, attach it to your laptop, and then use that to display the video.
  If you're interested in also being able to "beam" it from your computer to your game console (ex: PS3) ping me--I might have 
  something in mind that could help, though hasn't been created yet.  (Playon.tv does something like this, too, but
  I might come up with a competitor to it if desired, as it costs).
  If you're really ambitious and bleeding edge you could even try VGA over an Ethernet cable, too: 
  http://ps3mediaserver.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=5731#p34279  

Q. I want to give an edited DVD to a friend, how do I do that well?
A. Give them the original DVD and a link to sensible-cinema's website so they can download and use it.

== Caveats ==

NB that "someone" has to first create a delete list, per DVD.
If one doesn't yet exist for the DVD you want edited,
you could employ somebody to create it, or create it yourself.  Make sure to submit it
back to us when you're done, so that everyone can benefit from it.
Fortunately only one person has to do it, once, for everybody to benefit, and the 
editing process is fairly easy.

Also note that if your DVD has scratches that cause it to skip, the time signatures will be off, 
so we recommend to always clean your discs!

== Motivation ==

The initial motivation for the project was that I dislike deity profanity in movies.
And really any profanity is jarring, if you're not used to it in real life, and can
put you a bit on edge when you watch a movie.  
Also sometimes producers put in certain scenes (read: sex scenes) just to get a rating.
I don't want just those scenes, but still want to be able to watch the movies :)

I once tried Clearplay (a "filter"ed DVD player)
but (for me) it didn't seem to cut it.  It costs money monthly (I'm too cheap to pay--and many
many other people don't use it because of this fact...).  Their
filters sometimes don't cut out all unwanted content (ex: Saints and
Soldiers left profanity in...which wasn't what I had
expected, so they differed in standards somewhat).  
Others have noted that sometimes their edit timings (or perhaps DVD players)
are slightly mismatched so that it will mute sections just previous to profanity, while
not muting the profanity itself.  Clearplay apparently also runs a rather 
confusing subscription policy, I'm told [1], as well as selling DVD players that 
are a bit lackluster at times [2].
Clearplay also has little community collaboration/review (though you can email them feedback).
They no longer seem to have a "request a filter" option, though they used to.
They also don't have filters for all movies that I, at times, would like to watch edited (Condorman and Tron
lacking last time I checked...probably because they are too
obscure.) Also, some people watch movies only on computer, and they
no longer have a computer player, only hardware DVD players.  They also don't edit streamed
online movies either (last time I checked, anyway).  So overall I
wanted to build my own that overcame some of these hurdles.
I also emailed them once (2003?) to inform them I'd be making an open source
equivalent, and haven't heard back, which I assume to mean implicitly
they're all for it :)
Also no blu ray player support.
Also clearplay isn't quite flexible enough, editing out only offensive content.  Some users may want to,
for example, skip the intro to specific movies (read: older movies with long songs and no content) because...it's deemed boring.  Clearplay 
does not do that.  Also things skip-worthy include The prefix/endfix of Netflix
series' that they run together( ex: Dr. Who has 4 episodes in a row, with 4 jarring
main-title themes between them all.)

I also wanted to get a prototype out there of some of these ideas so that
others can't later patent them and pretend that they were first inventors :)

 "...I agree that it is not made clear on their website that if you don't continue your membership, you can't continue 
  to use the [previously downloaded] filters"

[2] http://deseretbook.com/ClearPlay-HDMI-DVD-Player-30-Day-Trial-Membership/i/5038491
 "We bought a clearplay player about 2 years ago. It worked great, until it just stopped working. I called their support line, 
  and they told us the model we got was defective, and that the new one was much better and we could get it at a discount, but 
  the next one just died also."

== History ==

Originally the project started off as a prototype that could "watch hulu (online) and netflix instant movies
edited" (it uses/used screen snap-shotting and tracks, using OCR, the on-screen
timestamp of the player, monitors it for specific times, and reacts appropriately).
However, this functionality, though working and available, is disabled currently for potential patent
concerns.
Some older released versions had it enabled, but not the latest releases.
Then I realized I could basically create the same effect using the
(deemed more patent friendly) pre-processing (slice out bad scenes) and/or deletion lists.  It basically was
Edit Decision Lists enforced using playlists and
VLC.  I.e. play from second x to y, now play then from z to second mu, muted, now from q to r, etc.
I just passed VLC a playlist, it did all the work for me, without any necessary real-time tracking.
There are a few released versions that did this.  It avoids real-time tracking by specifying "play from here to here"
not "skip from here to here" as some other editing players do.
Then it occurred to me that you could grab the several clean segments
off a DVD, and piece them together to create an edited version.  This also avoids 
realtime tracking, so I included that functionality.
I also added some mplayer EDL playback functionality later.
The playlist option is disabled in later releases, as it was deemed too user-non-friendly, and VLC timing
is "different" than standard DVD players, so I decided to just use standardized timing, though it worked fine
for VLC playback.

You can see a full list of features that have already been published and demonstrated
in the file ChangeLog.txt.  Each feature works in some released version of sensible-cinema
though some features or absent in later versions.  The changelog lists all of the 
features of the versions.

== Troubleshooting ==

Note that you'll need java previously installed for this to work.  Most people already do though.
If you run into a snag, it might have failed in "grabbing" the DVD, and only got part of it.
Try cleaning your DVD and starting over (delete all files, start again). 
Baking soda toothpaste might help with cleaning it.
If it still errs, report it, along with a screen snapshot and steps of
how to reproduce the problem, preferably.  See feedback section.

It can fail also because a deletion is past end of DVD, or 
Also note that if your DVD has scratches that cause it to skip, the time signatures will be off after that point, 
so clean your discs and try again!

Also make sure you aren't out of disk space.

Also you could try a different computer (desktop computers' DVD drives seem to work better at times than laptops')

Also (for power users) make sure your version of ffmpeg is relatively new, as older versions (r19313) is known to crop wrong.
If you don't know what this means then you're probably ok and don't have to worry about it.

"DVDNAV stream read error!"
  this typically means a dirty or scratched DVD.

You try to play back a sensible cinema-ized video file and it plays back without
 audio or video (example: windows media player)?

 This probably means you're using windows media player, and don't have "codecs" installed
   to handle this type of video.  Not to fear, just download the "ffdshow tryouts"
   and, when it gives you the option, be sure to check "mpeg2 video" and then
   it should "just work."  You could also play the file in VLC Media Player or smplayer
   (there's a button for that).

Thanks to Jarmo for the win32-screenshot gem, the mini_magick gem authors, jruby guys, etc.  
The combination of these tools made programming this actually something of a pleasure.
