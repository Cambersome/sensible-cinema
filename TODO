  timings: OS X everything...
  avidemux timings...
  "is a separate project with its own..."
  Does VLC grab really have off timings each time?
  We are not and cannot be held legally responsible for any third party use of this software (much like Microsoft et al cannot be held responsible for the use of Windows in illegal activities, etc.). Additionally we do <strong>not</strong> track the use of phpBB software in any way.
  timing info: mplayer OS X, VLC OS X, others? VLC ripped, converted...
  investigate: can I use the zoomplayer max?
  edit EDL to include realtime lists [zoom, etc.'s]
  timing: what about tron normal (non rental) DVD, does its mplayer get off a bit, too?
    if so, are there other DVD's that get off a bit, too, or is this a one time thing? huh?
  timing: if I can't find another that plays at 30/29.97 all the way through, buy Tron retail and (see if it does as the rental did)
    then make it work
  package curl [?] with its own license
  timing info on WMPC was off for some DVD or other? audio was off? huh?
  note we don't always use libdvdcss

      cheap minimize demo "fake auto" :)
      cheap static-ify demo for mutes
        also a straight almost mute one, using volume downs
    
    url -> url inference [hopefully this is cake...]
    cheap minimize via (probably foreground window + API real windows API) 
    manual select which to include into an EDL
    user preference "how many down clicks on volume for profanity"? 
    make it so it can suck in from "another wiki" the DL's, at package time, somehow (just one)
    youtube: use the javascript API somehow, like http://universalsubtitles.org/en/
      phase 1: does they use inferred timestamp?  can I use that generally, too? [do phase 1--publish simple javascript demo of it muting for awhile after startup]
    note that we have a unit test that can control mouse position, and monitor it for changes, and use this information to control mouse control, like feedback, less frequent jerk
    space -> advance from pause until next edit item?
    add fine grained "new ratings" to some demo EDL
    infer edl from url for netflix
    amazon player descriptor, just in case ;P
    make it able to "map" to a fake netflix' adjusted timing, just rough demo/unit test.
    can jerk mouse only every so often (cheap would be to just arbitrarily have it from x to y, demo that)
    can scan several player descriptors to "pick the right one"
    edited streamer screencast demo (the rumor guy demo, like zediva)
    incorporate the DL translator from the BYU-I fella
    post a demo of it playing back blu-ray edited local computer, +- projector, +- playon (?)
    fix the failing 9 digit test the fancy shmancy way :P
    post some playon.tv demo screencast...this should prove all shouldn't it [?]
    can "control mouse" to drag it to change location
    blu-ray player descriptor somehow
    does blu-ray playback work with my C++ project?
    beep at them/warn when not tracking [?]
      default on...I think.
    can jerk mouse more often closer to failure sections...
    can pull one from imdb at all, video "show it creates a file"
    make it suck in large list of EDL's from imdb at build time
    C player: minimize instead of skip :P
    C player: don't mute, just almost mute LOL or almost mute and static-ify
    can suck it in "in realtime" from online, and parse it, for demo purposes
    password protect it or whatever, to disallow heavier settings
    a UI to select categories, works
    edited blu ray movie playback screencast, as that's apparently not in the patent...
    don't use timecodes, use "% of the movie" and "total length" perhaps?
    look at their patents for other ideas? [all patents, nissim patents?]
    just pause it, tell them how far to fast forward at that point :P
    have the user forced to tell me what each digit is, themselves :P
    the online edl stuff itself
    javascript API
      phase 2: I can accomodate for pauses, too.
      phase 3: I can re-train based on events of stoppage
      phase 4: I can constantly poll and react
    post a demo of it streaming to a console device
    categories filterable by "level" "profanity level 2 and below is ok for me and my kids"
    maybe could just "play from x to y" [no exclude info?] 
    stage one: query, auto-download when they hit a netflix movie of some type
      stage two: chrome plugin for the same
    editor that can use OCR, too :P
    can insert deleted scenes et al [even external scenes :P]

  @legal: requires DVD 1st, and also tell them "make sure you have the drive in there if you ever watch it edited"
  @legal: one way is probably legal...
  note: you transfer (c) to me
  buy HP2, cool runnings :P
  buy forever strong italian, compare... :P
  create EDL: 10 commandments DVD to skip intro

  the fake blanker one doesn't work if title is off [real fix: add another button "just watch the thing" even for real users?]
    also it propagates the filename with weird, for other later buttons: Test_Delete_File_for_if_you_want_to_watch_something_straight_edited_version

  don't exit if a timestamps has same beginning as end, but do warn (is this a problem still?)
  check if the python one lines up or not/ping them on it

  the final "edited.avi" really "could/should" be playable in WMP...
  can I use ffmpeg to re-sync audio, and be able to re-play the edited copy, and thus avoid the small but extra harddup overhead (basically "just avoid")?
    I can live with "watching while grabbing" being lack luster...or maybe I can grab it with acodec copy (typically), then reencode it somehow later into something that is friendlier to computer players...or is it encoders?
      appears the only messed up audio one is smplayer...and probably mplayer with DVD's [?]

      one line at a time :P
      provide link for cheap DVD decoder if they lack one :)
    "round conservatively, yes write inaccurate file straight from DVD in pieces" ?
      then I guess they could play that file back immediately...?
    get half-way through (rip, start writing edited copy), then start playing back as continuing to write edited full copy (if windows allows...might have to watch it piece-wise)
    one that's "play DVD to x, now play it muted, now play it to y" (playlist? batch? ms?)
    one that's "rip and save first 20 minutes edited, start me on that, while doing the whole thing..." [?]
      except after 20 minutes you're hosed
    some super spiffy version that can grab and play "both" *on the fly* somehow LOL
      maybe one that is watching the extraction (get info, get info, get info...)...as it includes scene x, it adds it edited to the end of the final output file...
        This seems like the only real way.
    one that's "we're grabbing, but play from that via EDL or playlist against that file as it comes in"

    can use a fast temp drive, save through it to another :P
      (when they have two...)
  blu-ray support somehow (real-time? OCR?)
  double buffering hard drive/incoming copying from DVD might speed things, if your HD is fast.
    might not work for all modes tho...
  make the progress bar map "better" to the actual time that each section should take...

  @ffmpeg: rip to fulli mpeg -> ffmpeg -ovc copy -oac copy out.mpg -> no audio!
     and to .avi sometimes works, sometimes it results in static!

  can lop off sections/screen coords to save disk space (?)

@smplayer: right click on DVD...
the ac3 thing (I have to specify it...is this necessary? is it always ac3?) [basically, can I copy audio again?]

    probably only possible after creating the desktop streamer hmm

no releasing experimental for now, I guess

integrate with librivox' audio so you can avoid profanity in classics.  Somehow.  This would be nice for portable players.
  You know, for static things like this, a 'pre-cutter' would sure be convenient...
  provide download of edited mp3's for people.  ahhh.
  
itunes player for profanity (music)?

make a list of "known clean" movies...hmm...

an "online anybody can chat while watching this movie" (or anybody can edit this wav and listen to it as overlay...) prefer the latter.

an online applet web runnable? Why not?
  click here to watch your favorite film edited on hulu! Just click! [* yea!]
  
code refactors: "screen time change", order should be swapped in bin/x output (just cleanup)

easier installation for windows: self-extracting exe's :)
  later: .msi?

can blank overlay with added text like "and you are one awesome klingon"

ability to record it from online/live, then apply edits.

add my stuff to imdb...? make a wiki?

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", or "boring level x"

with VLC/youtube non full screen, it does the annoying mouse thing needlessly (which doesn't bug as much these days...)

can overlay with wav file (would work already for VLC [?], could also "click to mute" for others...hmm...)

the muting currently is so togglesy...if VLC ever fixes itself, fix this! 

fix any/all pending tests...

can permanently black out certain coords to keep things prettier...et al
  remove black when they really move the mouse?

Linux port (call that good enough for usability on TV's...), should be...
  OS X port

blanker outer with user specifiable color
  better default color?

Auto mute/blank commercials?

transfer ownership to a single LLC
  new github username
  new domains
  new sourceforge with that email
  new youtube

overlay/replace current playback with some url of audio or video
  user editable joke overlays (like a wiki...)
  realtime overlays (like group chat for those watching the film...)

control volume programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control mute programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control location programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.

compare VLC (and other) timings with a real DVD player, and with netflix instant, etc.

Have a "list of all known movies (url's)" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...
  or known parseable imdb's

does my sweet heart have any suggestions? (make it work well for laymen)

web browser plugin?
  popups *inside* netflix "play this edited" ?

Programmatically do all of the above, by driving VLC with libvlc (its API).
  So this would be basically tracking VLC using its libvlc callbacks, instead of screen times
  fork the Python project?
  VLC
    use VLC's web interface? telnet?
    optimize it with best appropriate iframes (LOL)

integrate with google TV...bravia...maybe...somehow...boxxee? roku?
  itunes TV? apple tv? ps3?

--server?  optionally higher prio?

@MRI:

irb(main):001:0> a = File.open('big1', 'w')
=> #<File:big1>
irb(main):002:0> a.seek 10_000_000_000
=> 0
irb(main):003:0> a.write 'b'
=> 1
irb(main):004:0> a.close # very slow mri 1.9.2
=======
take out all require 'rubygems'ses...

warn them when it looks like screen capture is very painful/expensive [is it too bad anyway, though] ? iff necessary

create a "book edit list" (word x is at position y...)

@dvd flick: 
  are your highest settings optimal?
  accept subtitled video...huh?
  accept multi-audio track videos
  
@smplayer: your CD config is awful.
@mencoder: can't split
something like you watch it *with* you friends and can all chat together...hmm...

do the same, but for books...also optimize them for reading through full volumes...you don't want a summary...don't want the title, know it's librivox...maybe say chapter x, that's it.  Probably start by just editing out the profanity, though :P Also do the Book of Mormon

@mencoder: ripping like this results in an (avidemux, VLC) fourcc of 'ugh':  mencoder2 dvdnav://1  -oac copy -ovc copy -o D:\raw_rip_mpeg_example.avi -endpos 20 -dvd-device E:\

@jruby: system("mencoder") from a button doesn't get interrupted by an exception [!]
@vlc: replay mp4's are too dark.

a DVD burner for ISO, then it can "burn over" some bad sectors? or you can grab an ISO and "null out" just where you wanted to?

maybe require them to rip their stuff "through some means or other" and we'll operate on the product based on an EDL list :) [could be more legal]


@rspec:   
1) EdlParser should raise for end before beginning
     Failure/Error: proc{ go({"mutes"=>{105=>104.9}})}.should raise_error(/SyntaxError/)
     expected Exception with message matching /SyntaxError/, got #<SyntaxError: warning--detected an end before a start 104.9 < 105.0>
     # edl_parser.spec.rb:115
     # :1
    
    message confusing :)

give money to nomachine--wow!

a boxee api? 
I *could* record netflix movies, then edit those manually (or mapped-ly)...meh clearplay needs some niche--we don't have each other after all.
donate to the top 25 sourceforge's that don't look illegal, esp. if haven't before
@mplayer: allow the equals in this: mplayer dvdnav:// -dvd-device=f:

opening youtube, if not already opened, choose chrome in plugin, get this:
RuntimeError: poor width or wrong window 94 1 71
     initialize at c:/dev/ruby/sensible-cinema/lib/screen_tracker.rb:54
  new_from_yaml at c:/dev/ruby/sensible-cinema/lib/screen_tracker.rb:27
          go_sc at bin\sensible-cinema-cli:94
         (root) at bin\sensible-cinema-cli:128
        [hard exit]

create a "map" of VLC DVD timings to "real" timings via tracking.  Hopefully never necessary...
        
if it looks paused I should basically pause my tracking [if it looks nothing, then keep going with my tracking]
it fails on "friday" tracks 0:48 as 1:48
probably at startup should not start at 0, either, wait for first screen trackage
figure out a way to get to the roku [ps3ms?], +- netflix edited to roku LOL

@avidemux: resave a file fails in a bizarre way :P

verbatim ISO copy, then scratch out appropriate bits?
