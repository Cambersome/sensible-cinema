      GetExitCodeProcess, wait for single object: http://www.codeguru.com/forum/showthread.php?p=390227
  compare computer DVD timings with physical player's timings...
    if same, add imdb todo's here
  mpeg is lossy (at least my current one pass conversion is)
  check the DVD burning experience too...
    could check if DVD Flick handles *oversize* files well, for information sake

  disallow choosing empty drive? fail more gracefully? (issue 11)
  some status bar that shows which DVD is in currently, how many match it, et al (pre button)
  splitter abs. coords option
  video on how to use imdb
    if times match DVD players
  alternate endings
  @ffmpeg there's no audio when going mpg -> mpg with copy!
  @mplayer you *die* with edl's on many DVD's... ex: on bunny one
    vendor\cache\mencoder\mplayer dvdnav://2 -nocache -edl C:\Users\packrd\AppData\Local\Temp\mplayer.temp.edl -dvd-device f:\
  with "preview segment" can't you preview it once it has passed that segment?
  can pull from imdb at package time [?]
  delete fulli file
    except if it's a specific scene run...
  mencoder harddup useful?
  .exe installer
    just unzips, runs the .bat file for them [?] :)
      full msi
  ask if you can somehow more easily grab to "mostly the same" exact codec (ffmpeg, mencoder mailing lists)
  split EDL's somehow into their own project/LLC...
  add md5 "warning" when something (anything) had failed disc fails doesn't match because of read failure...
  not loop on preview view (smplayer)
  LLC before ever pay anyone, if I ever do
  @DVD flick: support multi-track audio/subtitles (if they're already in the streams...)
  note the mplayer/smplayer as a player fast forward feature...
  several "play now" options...without a navigator of course :)
    visualbasic-like playlist
      one line at a time :P
      provide link for cheap DVD decoder if absent [ffdshow?] :)
    "round conservatively, write no file" playback
      mplayer batch (playlist?)
    "round conservatively, yes write file"
      then I guess they could play it back immediately...?
    get half-way through (rip, start writing edited copy), then start playing back as writing edited full copy
    one that's "play DVD to x, now play it muted, now play it to y" (playlist? batch?)
      one for watch unedited "as grabbing" (in create mode)
      can I do this super accurately anyway, more easily?
    one that's "rip and save first 20 minutes edited, start me on that, do the whole thing..." [?]
      except after 20 minutes you're hosed
    some super spiffy version that can grab and play "both" *on the fly* somehow LOL
      maybe one that is watching the extraction (get info, get info, get info...)...as it includes scene x, it adds it edited to the end of the final output file...
        This seems like the only real way.
    one that's "we're ripping, but play from that via EDL or playlist"
  whichr: return nil
    
 using+burning screencast
 editing screencast
  instructions on how to do their own (private) EDL or do one and submit it (public), or email their friends :P
  note how to get the title number
    add a way to get the label rather easily...
     add an option "just save full disk (unedited) to hard drive..."
       note to people: can edit those to your liking

  imagemagick (ffmpeg) easier install...
  DRY up dependency installation code
  install dep's to cache2 or something...so I can cleanup the deploy code...
  "Re-run most recent" disabled when there isn't one [?]
  re-do DVD EDL's that need it :P
  warn when labels exist and don't match...
  check all the many options to see if there's a "cross platform way to split files accurately" besides my hacky kludge.
  can rip from a DVD-like local folder (would anybody ever need this?)
  ripping "redoes" a large last section, for combining. Can I avoid this?
    plus I do some copy, some ac3 audio codec? huh? avoidable?
  @dvd flick do you need that frequent of i-frames?
  rename bat as template.bat
  add a developer readme
  can parse IMDB (require they put in the URL by hand fer now)
    add stuffs to imdb hmmm
    IMDB easy mapping
  can blank out the video, with audio continuing through...
  add an option "just save full disk (edited) to hard drive...well compressed"
    or do we want to do that by default anyway? (does it help burning? file size...hmm...)
@VLC: hard crash when ripping that one DVD...long one, about the constitution...
in general, fine tune burning with various things...

@rspec: it appears to *undo* my stub's after the test, so background threads choke (take out after...)

make sure can work with very large DVD's...
  can use a fast temp drive, save through it to another :P
    (when they have two...)
  can have collaborators re-selling EDL's
    good license for their stuff like "public domain" or what not :P Can't be a hypocrite now, can I?
a real website that looks good
k9 might preserve/shrink well...hmm...auto calculation may be possible...hmm...
better .exe icon...
blu-ray support somehow (real-time? rip?)
use DVD navigator ?
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd388584(v=VS.85).aspx
  with an avi file sink?
double buffering hard drive/incoming copying from DVD might speed things, if your HD is fast.
  might not work for all modes tho...
make the progress bar map "better" to the actual time that each section should take...

Note to people: clean your disks!
  in an exception
  
@mencoder: cannot rip from dvd with -ovc copy -oac copy (tearing)

@ffmpeg: rip to fulli mpeg -> ffmpeg -ovc copy -oac copy out.mpg -> no audio!
   and to .avi sometimes works, sometimes it results in static!

burnable to DVD/CD/multi DVD automagically... (auto-burn insert your new disk!)
    can *re-use* original navigation stuffs, less the profanity (is that possible? VobBlanker help, perhaps?)
  can lop off sections to save space (?)
  can burn extras from the DVD, too?
    optionally ?
  transcode to condense..?
  split to allow?
try to compile transcode in cygwin (yipes)

@smplayer: right click on DVD...
the ac3 thing (I have to specify it...is this necessary? is it always ac3?)
can have different volume settings
ask VLC "fuzzy menus on the happiest baby dvd expected?"
right click on DVD player, rip edited with SC?
@mplayer and VLC "you should seek better, like the ogg vorbis fellas recommend..."
report to jruby "when one thread dies, the GUI becomes unresponsive" (and others already previously reported to ruby-forum.com...)
  DVD's (right click on DVD player, play with SC?)
    use spiffy differentiation for DVD's on windows
a "certified clean" list
advertise my "splitting joining" google doc page. also test the various options there for accurateness :)
check for "newer version available" or not...
buy blu-ray decrypter, try it out.

== random non-DVD backlog ... note: just plow forward, to "grab" available ideas...except that for now, just what *I* plan on needing for myself (filters for what I need/want). ==

fade in/fade out volume, video
make the other stuff work again, since I no longer use YAML...

pass unit tests again jruby

speed up slow unit tests
can "watch as it is being ripped" (concat, watching it as it grows faster than you watch...)
make the overlay window uncloseable (?)
note that youtube can be downloaded then a local edited copy created, from that download. (mb add downloading ability?)
screencast of things helpful (use, creation...).
tune up the levels...
prototypes of the experimental stuff (overlay, track time while recording -> map file, specifiable levels, more?)

fix:
  0:01:01.9 next will be at 0:01:02.0s (r [or q to quit]):
  0:01:04.0 next will be at 0:01:06.5s (blanked) (r [or q to quit]): "warning--unable to track screen time for some reason" # *of course you can't track it now!*

byu.tv descriptor
youtube non full screen: work with all browsers
easier "here's how on the command line, BTW"
amazon player
a netflix player descriptor
  "just choose VLCx55" LOL
beep at them when not tracking [?]
  default on...hmm

Just fold if s....

a descriptor for some closed source app player...

can "overlay-audio/video"

blanker: allow for one side of the screen or another...

PISH
  release it with both until scared (?)
  split projects when scared (editor versus normal)/make projects work with direct editing, et al...
    split online from DVD, et al
  Note: get the whole thing working then release it all :P

check that youtube is working well again for all screen resolutions...

run it off a normal person (hulu, DVD). rinse and repeat

advertise on ruby flow

"ripperzy-ize" (low prio)
    can record from online [huh? do I even want this?]
      maybe can record something, then extract the bad, and get a better looking video...
      low prio
      remove commercials?
        myth cutlist?

DRY up :levels--it's in the ocr spec as well as the others...

unit tests run with normal ruby

back off on mouse jerking...only every so often?
  maybe increase timings as you get farther along, to accomodate for drift?

preference for beeping at them, et al

itunes video on demand player

blockbuster "rent" on demand player

no money making for now...all volunteer...more respectful.
  or make it so it can work with an editor of some kind...like a "save here" command line snip this tuck that.
    probably only possible after creating the desktop streamer hmm

no releasing experimental for now, I guess

integrate with librivox' audio so you can avoid profanity in classics.  Somehow.  This would be nice for portable players.
  You know, for static things like this, a 'pre-cutter' would sure be convenient...
  provide download of edited mp3's for people.  ahhh.
  
itunes player for profanity (music)?

make a list of "known clean" movies...hmm...

an "online anybody can chat while watching this movie" (or anybody can edit this wav and listen to it as overlay...) prefer the latter.

an online applet web runnable? Why not?
  click here to watch your favorite film edited on hulu! Just click! [* yea!]
  
code refactors: "screen time change", order should be swapped in bin/x output (just cleanup)

easier installation for windows: self-extracting exe's :)
  later: .msi?

can blank overlay with added text like "and you are one awesome klingon"

ability to record it from online/live, then apply edits.

add my stuff to imdb...? make a wiki?

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", or "boring level x"

with VLC/youtube non full screen, it does the annoying mouse thing needlessly (which doesn't bug as much these days...)

can overlay with wav file (would work already for VLC [?], could also "click to mute" for others...hmm...)

the muting currently is so togglesy...if VLC ever fixes itself, fix this! 

fix any/all pending tests...

can permanently black out certain coords to keep things prettier...et al
  remove black when they really move the mouse?

Linux port (call that good enough for usability on TV's...), should be...
  OS X port

blanker outer with user specifiable color
  better default color?

Auto mute/blank commercials?

transfer ownership to an LLC
  new github username

overlay/replace current playback with some url of audio or video
  user editable joke overlays (like a wiki...)
  realtime overlays (like group chat for those watching the film...)

control volume programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control mute programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control location programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.

compare VLC (and other) timings with a real DVD player, and with netflix instant, etc.

Have a "list of all known movies (url's)" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...
  or known parseable imdb's

does my sweet heart have any suggestions? (make it work well for laymen)

web browser plugin?
  popups *inside* netflix "play this edited" ?

Programmatically do all of the above, by driving VLC with libvlc (its API).
  So this would be basically tracking VLC using its libvlc callbacks, instead of screen times
  fork the Python project?
  VLC
    use VLC's web interface? telnet?
    optimize it with best appropriate iframes (LOL)

integrate with google TV...bravia...maybe...somehow...boxxee? roku?
  itunes TV? apple tv? ps3?

OCR the captioning as an auto profanity filter? (or perhaps download subtitles to be able to pre-screen), like the python fella does.

--server?  optionally higher prio?

irb(main):001:0> a = File.open('big1', 'w')
=> #<File:big1>
irb(main):002:0> a.seek 10_000_000_000
=> 0
irb(main):003:0> a.write 'b'
=> 1
irb(main):004:0> a.close # freeze mri 1.9.2

take out all require 'rubygems'ses...

package with portable imagemagick (meh)

create a "book edit list" (word x is at position y...)

@dvd flick: 
  don't re-encode if not necessary
  are your highest settings optimal?
  accept subtitled video...
  
@smplayer: your CD config is awful.
@mencoder: can't split
something like you watch it *with* you friends and can all chat together...hmm...
donate money to several projects I use/like :)

@mencoder: ripping like this results in an (avidemux, VLC) fourcc of 'ugh':  mencoder2 dvdnav://1  -oac copy -ovc copy -o D:\raw_rip_mpeg_example.avi -endpos 20 -dvd-device E:\
