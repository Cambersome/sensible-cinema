== medium ==

== low but actually want to do eventually (me) low prio: just do these...==

  youtube non full screen: work with other browsers
  make other players actually play again
  slightly more accurate timestamp...
  a chrome plugin with imdb/community backing :)

== random backlog ... based on user request..remember:  just local files for my own needs...==
note: just plow forward, to "grab" available ideas...except that for now, just what *I* plan on needing for myself.

an online applet web runnable? Why not?
  click here to watch your favorite film edited! Just click! [* yea!]

code refactors: "screen time change", order should be swapped in bin/x output

auto-play on detect youtube url...

easier installer for windows: release a zip file that they can just click on a .bat file to run it
  later: it installs/uninstalls appropo
    suggestion: self-extractor

make it able to use both windows and maximized VLC (and full screen)

can blank overlay text like "and you are one awesome klingon"

screencast of things helpful (use, creation).

TSR that monitors "oh you're opening a VLC? you're playing the E drive? That's bob's big plan? You're maximized? Full screened? watching x on hulu? y on youtube?"

a netflix online player descriptor
  
add my stuff to imdb...?

an imdb parser?

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", or "boring level x"

advertise like to lay men, to try to popularize

with VLC/youtube non full screen, it does the annoying mouse thing needlessly (which doesn't bug as much these days...)

hulu non full screened descriptor

can overlay with wav file (would work already for VLC [?], could also "click to mute" for others...hmm...)

fix any/all pending tests...

can permanently black out certain coords to keep things prettier...

Linux port (call that good enough for usability on TV's...), should be...

blank out with specifiable color
  better default color?

Auto mute/blank commercials?

transfer ownership to an LLC
  new github username

replay certain film sections :P

overlay/replace current playback with some url of audio or video
  user editable overlays (like a wiki...)

control volume programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control mute programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control location programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.

compare VLC timings with a real DVD player...

overlay with an alpha transparent pic

Have a "list of all known movies (url's)" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...

does my sweet heart have any suggestions? (make it work well for laymen)


some type of installer that can setup the registry...

auto-assignment of EDL's to media:
  auto-play option for DVD's (auto-start?)
    use normal differentiation
    use spiffy differentiation for DVD's on windows
  DVD's (right click on DVD player, play with scene-skipper?)
  web browser plugin?

Programmatically do all of the above, by driving VLC with its real API.
  VLC
    Allow it to record somehow (recordable)
     burnable to DVD/CD ...
    use VLC's web interface? telnet?

star trek: generations the first profanidade...
