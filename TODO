  after I do my own DVD's
    ask for more beta testers for use, ask for more beta testers for creation 
      facebook? lds lists?
  mpeg is lossy (at least my current one pass conversion still is...) and smplayer can't play it right unedited
    frame accurate splitter naive
  fast preview: change it to be aggressive sometimes yes, other times no
  10 minute splits for much faster viewage [edl fast preview seems way too lossy ?]
  beta release: rinse and repeat with various ppl

== DVD backlog (totally unordered, some very low prio, basically all never do) ==

 
  a fully javascript version...hmm...maybe an applet overlay [post 2020]
  alpha transparent "grey" overlay (for partial parts of the window)
  video using play on -> console (+- window only)
  certain sections: can speed them up, to make them less scary or what not, but you can still see what's happening. Not sure how audio could/should apply here.
  donate to mplayer, others [?] [VLC ja, which includes libdvdcss, h264 kind of] dvd flick alternative.to, dns hosting  
  google android TV app/iTV ?
  advertise ldsliving once I have patentable stuff done... [?]
  md5 the zips at release time
  somehow map DVD's to the "subdownloader" style subtitles?
    use their md5 now?
  advertise related bounties
  don't exit if a timestamps has same beginning as end, but do warn
  a pro website
  the final "edited.avi" really "could/should" be playable in WMP...
    but double check if they can watch it, either way.
  vendor ffmpeg
  can I use ffmpeg to re-sync audio, and be able to re-play the edited copy, and thus avoid the small but extra harddup overhead (basically "just avoid")?
    I can live with "watching while grabbing" being lack luster...or maybe I can grab it with acodec copy (typically), then reencode it somehow later into something that is friendlier to computer players...or is it encoders?
      appears the only messed up audio one is smplayer...and probably mplayer with DVD's [?]
        do this after frame accurate
  cleanup look of readme file
  can convert auto to JSON, too, for consumption by other players [?]
  use voice recognition for profanity [?]
  auto subit for filters [?]
  replay on iphone edited
  linearize edl's
    don't use them linear, just linearize
  add tooltips
  monkey.png is in bin...
  better icon
  better installer etc.
  note: can do the two types of preview at same time...concurrently...
  @mplayer: seeking to within EDL failz
  temple EDL at home, just finish don't burn
  some way for, super easy, as they play, it can mark the time signature and add it in...like super easy contribution...hmm...
    auto-upload?
  mencoder playlist mode/batch file style [?]
  just youtube for the various videos
  better icon
  don't exit program if they don't select a disk originally :)
  button start EDL playback from dvd here [?] (for create mode)
  re-play as EDL button for both modes--describe on the how to better
  fix prio for first ffmpeg instance [huh?]
  calculating md5...do this while they choose it [low prio] :)
  @dvd flick: right click on a movie file "write this file to DVD .iso as only title (no menu), burn this file as DVD only title (no menu)"
  @dvd flick: default should not be to loop
  @dvd flick: use first aspect ratio by default.
  burn from files to disc
  vendorize ffmpeg, then they don't have to install imagemagick...
  @smplayer: provide a command line param for "extra params to run this time around" or what not...
  check if a newer version of smplayer (+- forum links) can replace raw usage of mplayer now?
  integrate sub-titles-zy-er (like the Python fella)
    or maybe...use theirs?
  @mplayer: some way to not have to use phreaky pipes in doze ("+1")
  @ffmpeg: do you get slower the farther into large files you are?
  @ffmpeg: gop 12 for ntsc-dvd?
  @mplayer: why you can't play it when VLC can? huh? (audio sync)
  can watch conference like a music video :)
    can play "this section then that, with this one's audio
  add they 'play from unedited from grab till it hits the first bad spot', if useful [?]
  @smplayer: unable to seek in cars (once I figure out if this is specific to a particular DVD)
  @mplayer: edl disworks after a certain timestamp (after...)
  disallow:
    "0:45:00.0" , "00:450:10.0",  # second 2700
  all github issues
  a website that gives you a "wholesome meter"
  md5 and verify the fulli version... [?]
    only useful once I get the frame accurate stuff done, and any audio tweakage, etc.
  frame accurate splitter could be optimized, perhaps, split wise, speed wise?
  speedify things (the whole process takes approximately...eternity?)
  can I combine commands onto one command line for a quicker anything?
  can I get the original audio tracks back?
  show them how to use smplayer with subtitles
  can overlay with an image (DVD edited file)
  can you forceidx on the original copy and have mplayer replay EDL in realtime accurately or not, with audio?
    if not somehow, wait till video falls through, then see if I can...do something here with audio...yipers..
    sound accurate?
      back to audio copy? huh?
  calculating disk's unique id... -> gui somewhere
  @dvd flick: auto-detect the aspect ratio, if possible (?)
  ffmpeg handle 3F2R audio [sigh] [cars, should work with temple at lavc, too, bob dvd's are dual, I think...hmm...]
  an 'always blank not skip the mutes' option for paranoia
  dvdnav versus dvd for mplayer edl? (report)
  disallow choosing empty drive? fail more gracefully? (issue 11)
  video on how to use imdb
    if times match DVD players
  alternate endings et al
  @mplayer you *die* with edl's on many DVD's... ex: on bunny one
    vendor\cache\mencoder\mplayer dvdnav://2 -nocache -edl C:\Users\packrd\AppData\Local\Temp\mplayer.temp.edl -dvd-device f:\
  with "preview segment" can't you preview it once it has passed that segment?
  can pull from imdb at package time [?]
  delete fulli file automatically
    except if it's a specific scene run...
  FHE friendly: an option for "watch EDL as grabbed" (always harddup?)
  .exe installer
    just unzips, runs the .bat file for them [?] :)
      full msi
  ask if you can somehow more easily grab to "mostly the same" exact codec (ffmpeg, mencoder mailing lists)
  split EDL's themselves somehow into their own project/LLC...
  add md5 "warning" when something (anything) had failed disc fails doesn't match because of read failure...
  not loop on preview view (smplayer)
  LLC before ever pay anyone anything, if I ever do
  several "play now" options...without a navigator of course :)
    visualbasic-like playlist
      one line at a time :P
      provide link for cheap DVD decoder if they lack one :)
    "round conservatively, write no file" playback
      mplayer batch (playlist?)
    "round conservatively, yes write file"
      then I guess they could play it back immediately...?
    get half-way through (rip, start writing edited copy), then start playing back as writing edited full copy
    one that's "play DVD to x, now play it muted, now play it to y" (playlist? batch?)
      one for watch unedited "as grabbing" (in create mode)
      can I do this super accurately anyway, more easily?
    one that's "rip and save first 20 minutes edited, start me on that, do the whole thing..." [?]
      except after 20 minutes you're hosed
    some super spiffy version that can grab and play "both" *on the fly* somehow LOL
      maybe one that is watching the extraction (get info, get info, get info...)...as it includes scene x, it adds it edited to the end of the final output file...
        This seems like the only real way.
    one that's "we're ripping, but play from that via EDL or playlist"
    
  using+burning screencast
  editing screencast
   instructions on how to do their own (private) DL or do one and submit it (public), or email their friends :P
      add an option "just save full disk (unedited) to hard drive..."
        note to people: can edit these to your liking, resubmit
  DRY up dependency installation code
  install dep's to cache2 or something...so I can avoid redownload after a release...
  "Re-run most recent" disabled when there isn't one [?]
  warn when labels exist and don't match...
  can rip from a DVD-like local folder (would anybody ever need this?)
  rename bats as template.bats
  can parse IMDB (require they put in the URL by hand fer now)
    add stuffs to imdb hmmm
    IMDB easy mapping
  can blank out the video, with audio continuing through...
  @VLC: hard crash when ripping that one DVD...long one, about the constitution...
  in general, fine tune burning with various things...

    can use a fast temp drive, save through it to another :P
      (when they have two...)
  better .exe icon...
  blu-ray support somehow (real-time? rip?)
  double buffering hard drive/incoming copying from DVD might speed things, if your HD is fast.
    might not work for all modes tho...
  make the progress bar map "better" to the actual time that each section should take...

  @mencoder: cannot rip from dvd with -ovc copy -oac copy (tearing)

  @ffmpeg: rip to fulli mpeg -> ffmpeg -ovc copy -oac copy out.mpg -> no audio!
     and to .avi sometimes works, sometimes it results in static!

burnable to DVD/CD/multi DVD automagically... (auto-burn insert your new disk!)
    can *re-use* original navigation stuffs, less the profanity (is that possible? VobBlanker help, perhaps?)
  can lop off sections to save space (?)
  can burn extras from the DVD, too?
    optionally ?

@smplayer: right click on DVD...
the ac3 thing (I have to specify it...is this necessary? is it always ac3?)
can have different volume settings, like low volume instead of 0 [?]
ask VLC "fuzzy menus on the happiest baby dvd expected?"
report to jruby "when one thread dies, the GUI becomes unresponsive" (and others already previously reported to ruby-forum.com...)
  DVD's (right click on DVD player, play with SC?)
a "certified clean" list
advertise my "splitting joining" google doc page. also test the various options there for accurateness :)
a check for "newer version available" or not...
buy blu-ray decrypter, and drive, try it out.

== random non-DVD backlog ... note: just plow forward, to "grab" available ideas...except that for now, just what *I* plan on needing for myself (filters for what I need/want). ==

something that works with cable TV, too, somehow?
figure out why I need to uses dvdnav:// sometimes, dvd:// others to not crash :P

if sued, could use straight mplayer -ss (+- one at a time, or possibly in a playlist [?] like VLC can...)
  -hr-edl-seek ?

fade in/fade out volume, video
make the other stuff work again, since I no longer use YAML...

pass all unit tests again jruby

speed up slow unit tests
make the overlay window uncloseable (?)
note that youtube can be downloaded then a local edited copy created, from that download. (mb add downloading ability?)
screencast of things helpful (use, creation...).
tune up the levels...
prototypes of the experimental stuff (overlay, track time while recording -> map file, specifiable levels, more?)

fix:
  0:01:01.9 next will be at 0:01:02.0s (r [or q to quit]):
  0:01:04.0 next will be at 0:01:06.5s (blanked) (r [or q to quit]): "warning--unable to track screen time for some reason" # *of course you can't track it now!*

byu.tv descriptor
youtube non full screen: work with all browsers
easier "here's how on the command line, BTW"
amazon player
a netflix player descriptor
  "just choose VLCx55" LOL
beep at them when not tracking [?]
  default on...hmm

Just fold if s....

a descriptor for some closed source app player...

can "overlay-audio/video"

blanker: allow for one side of the screen or another...

PISH
  release it with both until scared (?)
  split projects when scared (editor versus normal)/make projects work with direct editing, et al...
    split online from DVD, et al
  Note: get the whole thing working then release it all :P

check that youtube is working well again for all screen resolutions...

run it off a normal person (hulu, DVD). rinse and repeat

advertise on ruby flow

"ripperzy-ize" (low prio)
    can record from online [huh? do I even want this?]
      maybe can record something, then extract the bad, and get a better looking video...
      low prio
      remove commercials?
        myth cutlist?

DRY up :levels--it's in the ocr spec as well as the others...

unit tests run with normal ruby

back off on mouse jerking...only every so often?
  maybe increase timings as you get farther along, to accomodate for drift?

preference for beeping at them, et al

itunes video on demand player

blockbuster "rent" on demand player

no money making for now...all volunteer...more respectful.
  or make it so it can work with an editor of some kind...like a "save here" command line snip this tuck that.
    probably only possible after creating the desktop streamer hmm

no releasing experimental for now, I guess

integrate with librivox' audio so you can avoid profanity in classics.  Somehow.  This would be nice for portable players.
  You know, for static things like this, a 'pre-cutter' would sure be convenient...
  provide download of edited mp3's for people.  ahhh.
  
itunes player for profanity (music)?

make a list of "known clean" movies...hmm...

an "online anybody can chat while watching this movie" (or anybody can edit this wav and listen to it as overlay...) prefer the latter.

an online applet web runnable? Why not?
  click here to watch your favorite film edited on hulu! Just click! [* yea!]
  
code refactors: "screen time change", order should be swapped in bin/x output (just cleanup)

easier installation for windows: self-extracting exe's :)
  later: .msi?

can blank overlay with added text like "and you are one awesome klingon"

ability to record it from online/live, then apply edits.

add my stuff to imdb...? make a wiki?

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", or "boring level x"

with VLC/youtube non full screen, it does the annoying mouse thing needlessly (which doesn't bug as much these days...)

can overlay with wav file (would work already for VLC [?], could also "click to mute" for others...hmm...)

the muting currently is so togglesy...if VLC ever fixes itself, fix this! 

fix any/all pending tests...

can permanently black out certain coords to keep things prettier...et al
  remove black when they really move the mouse?

Linux port (call that good enough for usability on TV's...), should be...
  OS X port

blanker outer with user specifiable color
  better default color?

Auto mute/blank commercials?

transfer ownership to an LLC
  new github username

overlay/replace current playback with some url of audio or video
  user editable joke overlays (like a wiki...)
  realtime overlays (like group chat for those watching the film...)

control volume programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control mute programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control location programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.

compare VLC (and other) timings with a real DVD player, and with netflix instant, etc.

Have a "list of all known movies (url's)" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...
  or known parseable imdb's

does my sweet heart have any suggestions? (make it work well for laymen)

web browser plugin?
  popups *inside* netflix "play this edited" ?

Programmatically do all of the above, by driving VLC with libvlc (its API).
  So this would be basically tracking VLC using its libvlc callbacks, instead of screen times
  fork the Python project?
  VLC
    use VLC's web interface? telnet?
    optimize it with best appropriate iframes (LOL)

integrate with google TV...bravia...maybe...somehow...boxxee? roku?
  itunes TV? apple tv? ps3?

OCR the captioning as an auto profanity filter? (or perhaps download subtitles to be able to pre-screen), like the python fella does.

--server?  optionally higher prio?

@MRI:

irb(main):001:0> a = File.open('big1', 'w')

take out all require 'rubygems'ses...

package with portable imagemagick (meh)

create a "book edit list" (word x is at position y...)

@dvd flick: 
  are your highest settings optimal?
  accept subtitled video...huh?
  accept multi-audio track videos
  
@smplayer: your CD config is awful.
@mencoder: can't split
something like you watch it *with* you friends and can all chat together...hmm...

@mencoder: ripping like this results in an (avidemux, VLC) fourcc of 'ugh':  mencoder2 dvdnav://1  -oac copy -ovc copy -o D:\raw_rip_mpeg_example.avi -endpos 20 -dvd-device E:\

@jruby: system("mencoder") from a button doesn't get interrupted by an exception [!]
@vlc: replay mp4's are too dark.

@rspec:   
1) EdlParser should raise for end before beginning
     Failure/Error: proc{ go({"mutes"=>{105=>104.9}})}.should raise_error(/SyntaxError/)
     expected Exception with message matching /SyntaxError/, got #<SyntaxError: warning--detected an end before a start 104.9 < 105.0>
