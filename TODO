  ffmpeg compile it in mingw, see if it runs dshow windows
  clarify input for srt (remove those old ones)
    also double check edl_parser unit tests, and if I do one in the middle and timestamps way past it does it work

    do another srt comparison with netflix...see if it matches less 1s
  "srt" double checker "ok now at exactly this time this should be here."
   java webstart for being able to playback netflix instant edited "automagically"

    break out into its own separate window?
    @XBMC: your stuff is broken in at least these two ways (bug reports)
    also are they 30fps or not? and how do they handle timesplits?
    is there another format that will actually mute?
    XBMC mode doesn't mind the 600 starting offset...
      oh wait we weren't even using it right to begin with LOL
      plus it needs to "always just skip instead of mute" for now I guess
      report XBMC bugs, too.
  research VOB dirs
    still needs timesplits? what about in XBMC? what about XBMC with DVD's
  @avisynth: 6 fps from 2? huh? also why are some progs [ffmpeg] seemingly resetting the graphedit pins? huh? also tell that one already logged bug how I work around it...
  sout-keep for VLC EDL'ish or playlist?

    I'm almost beginning to think VLC for files, DEBUG_C player for DVD's (except on mac, where they just have to live hosed)
    or maybe...umm...ask the dvdnav people why it might work with one and not the other? ask VLC? huh? what the...
    call out to VLC on DVDNAV_ERROR occurrence? what the... if can reproduce, submit bug report with trace et al.
  report ffmpeg bugs as real bugs, mplayer various (as bugs):P

  note "you want to optimize your reverse blitting first... :)"
  if 2 EDL's, still can choose a title trackfor automatically playing it right.
  fast preview: change it to be aggressive sometimes yes, other times no
  fast preview mode: watch for modifications to file, kill mplayer instances for them on change :)
  fast preview tends to "go too far" [like the end of profanity is still there when played via the "real way"]
  note to them [in how_to_create]: can do the two types of preview at same time...concurrently...to save time...
  investigate: use zoomplayer max cutscene support?

  can I make playback more smooth by upping mplayer cache? does smplayer pass it a parameter? It does jerk a bit doesn't it, on slower?
  can I just use ffmpeg for an initial -> ts ? http://eotmsnotes.wordpress.com/2011/04/25/tsmuxer-notes/

  @mplayer: dump core needs a better message..could use one http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/mplayer-users/2007-February/065420.html
  @mplayer: -edl nonexist should warn [?] also when it hits an EDL sector ouput something plz?
  @mplayer: allow EDL to have full timestamps for ease of editing :)
  add an mencoder convert with mplayer_breaks button :P
    can I just use mencoder -hr-edl-seek (off mpeg) to avoid the fulli phase? please? does it work super-accurately, though, off fulli? off other?
    maybe just under an "advanced" window...
  @mplayer homepage: list mulder's not smplayer's, plz?
    also smplayer advertise it even more prominently :P
  ask mplayer "could you make the OSD available to smplayer so it can get the right timestamps at least for its display?"
  make this thing load faster: don't require rubygems...uh...faster_require?
  does xbmc need a "convert to 30fps edl" for DVD?

  @macports: set notestxt \
  13	    "The MPlayer developers do not believe in making regular releases. \
  14	    You are likely better off using the mplayer-devel port." *before* and after (?) (double check it--would one way work ok? mplayer)
  can I use mplayer's "-edlout" to simplify something something, or maybe I should slave mode mplayer for my own means of the same?
  create real plugins for boxee, XBMC et al
  can "blur out" scenes, or specific pixels on frames, like that guy bleeping out his own profanity just lips plus bleep
  a new button (maybe just in advanced mode?) "play EDL mplayer from file (no transcoding)" [if anybody ever would want/need it--seems related to the new c-based player kind of...?]
  if it doesn't parse a file you choose it annoyingly loops *forever* "error pooping" "error pooping" [?]
  "real" dvdid for blu-ray, can work with them (once I figure out timing info...)
  accept the "user inputable" profanities, based on the DVD (like "thor" or what not...)
  can I train the ps3ms to play a real DVD, with EDL ?
  create an XBMC plugin that auto-searches for...ummm...uh...filters for you? huh? some type of plugin?
    just create the side by side .EDL for various files for people.
  make a mymovies plugin to auto-use EDL's somehow... ?
  an almost rifftrax that...says "here overlay x, change normal volume to 50% during that time..."
  check if tmdb needs some type of upload...hmm...to save them... ask that one guy if I can bribe him into doing it? dvdxml? dvdid.info?
  allow for filtered subtitles, a la "always skip" [?]

  fix ffmpeg's  Application provided invalid, non monotonically increasing dts to muxer in stream 0: 5940 >= 5940
  @makemkv: wrong title no:Title #0 was added (7 cell(s), 0:14:58)
     Title #1 was added (8 cell(s), 0:14:57), also give us title no's in the dialog :P
  @mencoder you lop off the end somehow (dvd rip)
  blu ray timing
    my one, others.  Are they the same as DVD's?  They seem really close...
  pull in information from thetvdb to the GUI app
  create the "ffmpeg frame accurate" splitter
    sounds like I want to move in that direction, esp. if handbrake ends up being sane
  research the gplv3, add terms. Maybe want real lawyer, even?
  it can "slow certain sections down" that might look way cool! LOL
  it can "speed up" certain [scary/frightening] sections, to make them less tense
  script powerdvd via keystrokes
  VLC: suggest uservoice
  can I just use mencoder with an EDL parameter to possibly split/join more quickly or something?
  10 minute splits for much faster viewage [edl fast preview seems way too lossy ?]

  check why out of sync my turn on earth on blacky MPH-HC
    does it with other players...?
  super spiffy editor that tracks timestamps for you for new lines
  create a uservoice/uservoice+ for my own [?]
  note that I might be able to make a half and half player that just "sleeps"...if I can get the timing just right...(is this what mplayer does)
  don't exit if a timestamps has same beginning as end, but do warn (is this a problem still?)
  mpeg is lossy (at least my current one pass conversion still is...) and smplayer can't play it right unedited
    only if asked?
  certain sections: can speed them up, to make them less scary or what not, but you can still see what's happening. Not sure how audio could/should apply here.
  advertise related bounties to their various groups
  create a really snazzy pro looking website
  can I use ffmpeg to re-sync audio, and be able to re-play the edited copy, and thus avoid the small but extra harddup overhead (basically "just avoid")?
    I can live with "watching while grabbing" being lack luster...or maybe I can grab it with acodec copy (typically), then reencode it somehow later into something that is friendlier to computer players...or is it encoders?
      appears the only messed up audio one is smplayer...and probably mplayer with DVD's [?]
        do this after frame accurate
  @mplayer: seeking to within an EDL failz 
  can make community overlay "comments" somehow or other/whatever cyberlink does :)
    based on timestamps, transparent overlay
  re-look through all my old "thoughts" notes/blogs
  mplayer playlist mode possible, like real playlist?
  add button start EDL playback from dvd here [?] (for create mode)
  fix prio for very first ffmpeg instance not being settable [huh?]
  check if a newer version of smplayer (+- forum links) can replace raw usage of mplayer now?
  integrate sub-titles-zy-er auto-download 
    I could integrate discid => hashes => opensubtitles.org 
    http://themoviedb.lighthouseapp.com/projects/17044-themoviedborg/tickets/142
    their mkv player probably does some lookup 'er other...maybe...for dvd's
    I really need to tell tvdb to allow for discid, and/or themoviedb to allow for series'
  @mplayer: some way to not have to use phreaky phreaky pipes in doze ("+1")
  @ffmpeg: gop 12 for ntsc-dvd?
  can watch conference like a music video :)
  can play "this section then that, with this one's audio [wow that is fringey]
  speedify things (the whole process takes approximately...eternity?)
  can overlay with an arbitrary image (I think mencoder can actually do this...)
  ffmpeg handle 3F2R audio [sigh] [cars, should work with temple at lavc, too, bob dvd's are dual, I think...hmm...]
  an 'always blank not skip the mutes' option for hard core

  @mplayer you *die* with edl's on many DVD's... ex: on bunny one
    vendor\cache\mencoder\mplayer dvdnav://2 -nocache -edl C:\Users\packrd\AppData\Local\Temp\mplayer.temp.edl -dvd-device f:\
  .exe installer
    just unzips, runs the .bat file for them [?] :)
      full msi
  LLC before I ever pay anyone anything, if I ever do
  add some or any of the following "play now" options...without a true navigator of course :)
    "round conservatively, yes write inaccurate file straight from DVD in pieces" ?
      then I guess they could play that file back immediately...?
    get half-way through (rip, start writing edited copy), then start playing back as continuing to write edited full copy (if windows allows...might have to watch it piece-wise)
    one that's "play DVD to x, now play it muted, now play it to y" (playlist? batch? ms?)
    one that's "rip and save first 20 minutes edited, start me on that, while doing the whole thing..." [?]
      except after 20 minutes you're hosed
    some super spiffy version that can grab and play "both" *on the fly* somehow LOL
      maybe one that is watching the extraction (get info, get info, get info...)...as it includes scene x, it adds it edited to the end of the final output file...
        This seems like the only real way.
    one that's "we're grabbing, but play from that via EDL or playlist against that file as it comes in"
  
  create a how to use screencast
  editing/creating screencast
   instructions on how to do their own (private) DL or do one and submit it (public), or email their friends :P

  "Re-run most recent" disabled when there isn't one [?]
  can rip from a DVD-like local folder (would anybody ever need this?)
  can blank out the video, with audio continuing through...
  can use a fast temp drive, save through it to another :P
    (when they have two...)
  double buffering hard drive/incoming copying from DVD might speed things, if your HD is fast.
    might not work for all modes tho...
  make the progress bar map "better" to the actual time that each section should take...

  @ffmpeg: rip to fulli mpeg -> ffmpeg -ovc copy -oac copy out.mpg -> no audio!
     and to .avi sometimes works, sometimes it results in static!

  can lop off sections/screen coords to save disk space (?)

@smplayer: right click on DVD...
the ac3 thing (I have to specify it...is this necessary? is it always ac3?) [basically, can I copy audio again?]
make it so it can have different volume settings, like low volume instead of just always 0
an auto-check for "newer version available" automagically not...
warn when labels both exist and don't match...

@mplayer warn before overwrite
@mplayer you cannot convert mkv files correctly you silly!

== random non-DVD/OCR backlog ... or a few never do DVD. ==

auto-mute during hulu commercials [annoying!]
fix the audio timestamps for my capturer...

@mplayer: you return the wrong return code, sillys! https://gist.github.com/1056292
@smplayer: bounty or me fix: their for their display [if they use get_time_pos isn't that enough ?]
  @mplayer is it really too slow [link], and there thus no hope for EDL working right? maybe it could change to be based off the get_time_pos ?
Also things skip-worthy include The prefix/endfix of Netflix
series' that they run together( ex: Dr. Who has 4 episodes in a row, with 4 jarring
main-title themes between them all.)   This type of thing

some low level frame hijacker for incoming cable movies, too? ... hmm...
  not hijacker, but monitor to detect location/position

can die when doesn't start well:

can synchronize hulu/netflix instant play, for girlfriends
create avisynth realtime EDL'er

when mouse jerks the "first" time--don't count the next reading!  It's the next transition that matters..I think so...
  or count it as "worst possible"?
  it's off by up to 1s, at the least...hmm...

@mplayer: why you can't play some sound files when VLC can? huh? (audio sync) (mpeg issues, probably...yikes mplayer...could file a bounty for us maybe? inquity?)
advertise my "splitting joining" google doc page. also test the other various options there for accurateness :)
use voice recognition for profanity [?]
take out use_class_name for descriptors

if sued, could use straight mplayer -ss (+- one at a time, or possibly in a playlist [?] like VLC can...)
  -hr-edl-seek ?

fade in/fade out volume, video, instead of just hard muting it as it does currently, or hard overlay blanking it, or skipping.
make the other stuff work again, since I no longer use YAML...

pass all unit tests again jruby

speed up slow unit tests
make the overlay window uncloseable (?)
note that youtube can be downloaded then a local edited copy created, from that download. (mb add downloading ability?)
screencast of things helpful (use, creation...).
tune up the levels...
prototypes of the experimental stuff (overlay, track time while recording -> map file, specifiable levels, more?)

fix:
  0:01:01.9 next will be at 0:01:02.0s (r [or q to quit]):
  0:01:04.0 next will be at 0:01:06.5s (blanked) (r [or q to quit]): "warning--unable to track screen time for some reason" # *of course you can't track it now!*

byu.tv descriptor
youtube non full screen: work with all browsers
amazon player
"just choose VLCx55" LOL

Just fold if s....

can "overlay-audio/video"

blanker: allow for one side of the screen or another...

PISH
  release it with both until scared (?)
  split projects when scared (editor versus normal)/make projects work with direct editing, et al...
    split online from DVD, et al
  Note: get the whole thing working then release it all :P

check that youtube is working well again for all screen resolutions...

advertise on ruby flow

DRY up :levels--it's in the ocr spec as well as the others...

unit tests run with normal ruby

back off on mouse jerking...only every so often?
  maybe increase timings as you get farther along, to accomodate for drift?

preference for beeping at them, et al

itunes video on demand player description

blockbuster "rent" on demand player description

no money making for now...all volunteer...more respectful.
  or make it so it can work with an editor of some kind...like a "save here" command line snip this tuck that.
    probably only possible after creating the desktop streamer hmm

integrate with librivox' audio so you can avoid profanity in classics.  Somehow.  This would be nice for portable players.
  You know, for static things like this, a 'pre-cutter' would sure be convenient...
  provide download of edited mp3's for people.  ahhh.
  
itunes player for profanity (music)?

an "online anybody can chat while watching this movie" (or anybody can edit this wav and listen to it as overlay...) prefer the latter.

an online applet web runnable? Why not?
  click here to watch your favorite film edited on hulu! Just click! [* yea!]
  
easier installation for windows: self-extracting exe's :)
  later: .msi?

can blank overlay with specifiable text like "and you are one awesome klingon"

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", and/oor "boring level x or greater"

with VLC/youtube non full screen, it does the annoying mouse thing needlessly (which doesn't bug as much these days...)

the muting currently is so togglesy...if VLC ever fixes itself, fix this! 

Linux port (call that good enough for usability on TV's...), should be...

blanker outer with user specifiable color
  better default color?

Can auto mute/blank/skip  commercials?

transfer ownership to a single LLC
  new github username
  new domains
  new sourceforge with that email
  new youtube

overlay/replace current playback with some url of audio or video
  user editable joke overlays (like a wiki...)
  realtime overlays (like group chat for those watching the film...)

Have a "list of all known movies (url's)" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...

does my sweet heart have any suggestions? (make it work well for laymen)

integrate with google TV...bravia...maybe...somehow...boxxee? roku?
  itunes TV? apple tv? ps3?
  probably via broadcast...

take out all various require 'rubygems'ses...

warn them when it looks like screen capture is very painful/expensive [is it too bad anyway, though] ? iff necessary

create a "book edit list" (word x is at position y...)

@dvd flick: 
  are your highest settings optimal?
  accept subtitled video...huh?
  accept multi-audio track videos
  
@smplayer: your CD config is awful.
@mencoder: can't split
something like you watch it *with* you friends and can all chat together...hmm...

do the same, but for audio books...also optimize them for reading through full volumes...you don't want a summary...don't want the title, know it's librivox...maybe say chapter x, that's it.  Probably start by just editing out the profanity, though :P Also do the Book of Mormon

@mencoder: ripping like this results in an (avidemux, VLC) fourcc of 'ugh':  mencoder2 dvdnav://1  -oac copy -ovc copy -o D:\raw_rip_mpeg_example.avi -endpos 20 -dvd-device E:\

@jruby: system("mencoder") from a button doesn't get interrupted by an exception [!]
@vlc: replay mp4's are too dark.

a DVD burner for ISO, then it can "burn over" some bad sectors? or you can grab an ISO and "null out" just where you wanted to?

maybe require them to rip their stuff "through some means or other" and we'll operate on the product based on an EDL list :) [could be more legal]

a boxee api? 
I *could* record netflix movies, then edit those manually (or mapped-ly)...meh clearplay needs some niche--we don't have each other after all, plus legality

opening youtube, if not already opened, choose chrome in plugin, get this:
RuntimeError: poor width or wrong window 94 1 71
     initialize at c:/dev/ruby/sensible-cinema/lib/screen_tracker.rb:54
  new_from_yaml at c:/dev/ruby/sensible-cinema/lib/screen_tracker.rb:27
          go_sc at bin\sensible-cinema-cli:94
         (root) at bin\sensible-cinema-cli:128
        [hard exit]

create a "map" of VLC DVD timings to "real" timings via tracking.  Hopefully never necessary...
  hopefully I can really fix VLC instead
        
it fails on "friday" it tracks 0:48 as 1:48
probably at startup should not start at 0, either, wait for first screen trackage
