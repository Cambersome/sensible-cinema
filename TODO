== roadmap [for just tasks, see below though] ==

  release: cheap inventionzy
  release: C EDL+specific portion player
  ?? below ??
  pull realtime players from mine/update todo/make mine take a file
    possibly just say "I do it from file, here's how to most easily rip to a file, just look at the title track, then download either VLC or smplayer, then..."
  build library phase, 20 dvd's
  create web site/api
  propagate wikipedia with list of realtimers etc.
    don't mention mplayer EDL, just link to wikipedia :P
  more build library
  
== high prio like blocking bugs ==  
  
== up next release/very next task: ==

  high prio patents
  ffmpeg gop 1 on handbrake [?]
    if this works (which it prolly won't) then recommend handbrake
    else just tell them to use VLC or mplayer <sigh>
    if so tell them "search handbrake's forum for libdvdcss.dll"
  
== yes do, un-ordered currently ==

  @themoviedb: main title, also delete, don't you want to be a DVD database, not solely a movie database?
    maybe tvdb allow imdb linking, lookup of DVD by sig
  BY CLICKING "I Agree" YOU SIGNIFY THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED TO ABIDE BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT
  do I need/want to accomodate for m4v somehow?
  make install work again
    package curl [?]
  add button "play from exactly here to here" in mplayer uh guess :P
  leave in "play from x to y mplayer from DVD" I think :P [more?]
  what does mplayer do with -ss big_number past the end of an end [monster's inc]?
  Watch...unedited smplayer button doesn't play from the right device if you have two :P
  get LLC before "real" domain name
  add profanity filter this file button
  remove some buttons by default ?
  always force them to have a DVD in the drive :P
  clear runnings
    have ben and chris test it out, have it work, then ask about video quality
    me try my copy
  try disney digital copy/amazon library "local download"
  figure out handbrake use for splitting
  blu ray timing
  legal:
     rename the file to is_it_legal_to_copy_dvds, reference it
    "we know x, y are not l..."
    agree to abide, shouldn't in the US [?]
  C player:
    use DVD navigator
    wow terrifying...
    just use mplayer EDL syntax, plus title track :)
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms787412(VS.85).aspx
  	http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd407175(v=VS.85).aspx can be synchronous? might be a good first pass...
    PlayPeriodInTitleAutoStop EC_DVD_PLAYPERIOD_AUTOSTOP
    make it frame accurate output text :)
      after done:
        note we don't always use libdvdcss in the legal
    allow it to "just play from X to Y exactly" ...
    does this line up right? can it work, at all?
      lodo:
        update its semi-bad error messages...
        show time remaining, too, and less ugly [?]
        can come out of full screen more easily :P
    note pay for XP http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-media-player/plug-ins search for the cheapest
    note to them windows vista/7: use ac3filter
  if it doesn't parse it loops *forever* "error pooping" "error pooping"
  try buy delete lists from all x,y,z [?] maybe ask for them for free first?
  do open_edl_list_org_todo.txt file
  @legal: requires DVD 1st, and also tell them "make sure you have the drive in there if you ever watch it edited"
  create the following EDL: 10 commandments DVD to skip the intro music LOL
  the fake blanker EDL doesn't work well... [real fix: add another button "just watch the thing" even for real users?]
    also it propagates the filename with weird, for other later buttons: Test_Delete_File_for_if_you_want_to_watch_something_straight_edited_version
  donate menumeter $
  just reference their (non local) copy of gplv1 etc.
  create local new DL's to a separate, different folder
  that one button is broken...play with [s]mplayer unedited [?]
  tool tips for all buttons...tweak naming, too :P do something!
  the "play DVD with smplayer unedited" prompts for delete list
  fix the "play previously credited edited file for current DVD" button
  vendorize smplayer * 2
    test if latest smplayer can work with edl and seek [?]
    be able to use smplayer, never just mplayer [yikes]
    apparently just using webdl is like r30369 yipers
  note to previewer "you are about to preview these specific edits..." ?
  ask for more beta testers for use, ask for more beta testers for creation, too
  beta release: rinse and repeat with various ppl
  switch to using sourceforge solely for the new hosting...
  youtube videos -> new account name
  propaganda-ize (file)
  vendorize a copy of ffmpeg, then they don't have to install imagemagick...also then we'll have ffprobe
    and sanity
  note "pay us/somebody to do it for you on the google group"?
  note "this is the full list--your help is wanted/needed"
  create a semi-accurate phantom edit EDL
    http://www.chefelf.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=6176
  calculating disk's unique id... -> have it note on gui...
  don't exit program if they don't select a disk originally :) e.g. if they cancel out of "Please pick a DVD Delete list file"
  tell them "you can open the file for more specific editing accuracy of timestamps via microsoft DVD creator" or whatever it is.
  mplayer OSD
  re-run with the test DVD's
  another full pass on verbiage legal, etc.
  better md5

== DVD decide later to move up or down ==


== DVD-realtime backlog yes [?] do, unordered ==

  for mplayer realtime it needs to start early, but end on time
  mplayer instructions are obscured
  mplayer EDL allow 
    got fatal exception in button
    detected an overlap 1397.51 1401.275 mute 1395.474 1397.874 mute
    SyntaxError
  accept "mplayer_dvd_splits" => ["4749"] [large second integers...hmm...]
  it should clear old smplayer options on startup always, just in case, somehow
  fast preview: change it to be aggressive sometimes yes, other times no
  fast preview mode: watch for modifications to file, kill mplayer instances for them on change :)
  fast preview tends to "go too far" [like the end of profanity is still there when played via the "real way"]
  mplayer EDL while grabbing, from grabbed :P
  auto-download and run for them the smplayer install exe [avoid scary sourceforge/extra step]
  force them to use my bundled mplayer version (currently it doesn't install to vendor/cache if you have an mplayer in the path, then fails to start mplayer)
    ideal would be use smplayer with my mplayer
  note to them [in how_to_create]: can do the two types of preview at same time...concurrently...to save time...

== DVD/DVD realtime backlog (totally unordered, some very low prio, basically all never do) ==

  todo.subtitle
  @VLC you lop off the end, somehow, I guess...
  make it not die if you have no DVD in there yet when you choose a drive...
  the "frame accurate" splitter
    sounds like I want to move in that direction, esp. if handbrake ends up being sane
  bounty dvdnav (calendar will ping me)
  @mencoder you lop off the end somehow
  @VLC convert -> dump raw always displays--expected? also saves nothing?
  fix dvdnav?
  research the gplv3, add terms. Maybe want real lawyer, even?
  note "others are released under this license, that license"
  note/include jruby license, include gplv1 et al, note "also included locally"
  check if md5 same mac versus PC for VLC/mplayer rips, VLC done several times/fix too
  figure out how to fix avidemux being like...still barely off frame-rate wise hmm...
    bounty avidemux handle: demux_mpg: 24000/1001fps progressive NTSC content detected, switching framerate. sniff
  check if opening in MS editor is 29.97 or not
  disallow choosing empty drive? fail more gracefully when they do?
  investigate: can I use the zoomplayer max?
  sons of provo "music video"
  finish monsters inc. fella
  it can "slow certain sections down" that looks cool! :)
  XP timings with cineplayer [osoh, jonah]
  how does this one download subtitles? http://www.pcworld.com/article/227465/freebie_splayer_plays_almost_any_video_fileand_looks_good_doing_it.html
    also xbmc has a plugin
  script powerdvd?
  VLC: make some more bounties: per file save location at least, anything else [check for suggestions]
    also suggest uservoice ?
  
  If I use VLC, does cacheing help CPU/disk grabbing? 
    http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows/fix-for-vlc-skipping-and-lagging-playing-high-def-video-files/
    update VLC forum if so
  can I just use mencoder with an EDL parameter to possibly split/join more quickly or something?
  force an install of VLC, too
  todo.subtitle file
  10 minute splits for much faster viewage [edl fast preview seems way too lossy ?]
  make optional though? hmm time for a third type blank but non mute...
  port to linux
  "release" it to more developers
    plug.org, more rubyists?
    after OS X :)
  port to OS X overall
  @VLC also tell them to tell people how to play hi-def better, when they try [?] if it shtinks
  an all online EDL editor
    flash canvas
    OCR?
    hotkeys
    advanced editing, like sub-parts of frames, with each way to specify the sub-parts
  donate http://lame.buanzo.com.ar
  donate winscp, sox, 
  do todo.inventionzy.txt
  an "automatic mplayer split finder" :)
  buy forever strong italian, compare... :P
  mac version of the C player 
    "just play from X to Y exactly" 
  forever strong DVD timestamps [and other?], compare timestamps with amazon VoD, too, also jonah amazon VoD [if desired?]
  take out the extra console window box output :) [scary, and closing it closes SC!]
  auto-feedback on crashes [?]
  publish new version of rdp-win32screenshot, if it ever existed
  script avidemux, as a demo?
  accomodate failed deletes [files in use] better than dying with a backtrace
  vendorize ffmpeg, to avoid "scary" warning on install of imagemagick/scary active x
  machine learning for video analysis [?]
  transcribe the audio of movies? crowd source it? whoa!
  figure out how to auto-crop after grab?
  figure out some way to work with cable providers/iphones/gphones?
  @smplayer: why do you sometimes start with subtitles enabled?
  don't need to package rdp-win32screenshot et al for just DVD work...
  bring in batch file mplayer :)
  make my website slightly more "pictures-zy"
  check why out of sync my turn on earth on blacky MPH-HC
  super spiffy editor that tracks timestamps for you for new lines
  create a uservoice/uservoice+
  note that I might be able to make a half and half player that just "sleeps"...if I can get the timing just right...(is this what mplayer does)
  don't exit if a timestamps has same beginning as end, but do warn (is this a problem still?)
  check if the python one lines up or not/ping them on it
  mpeg is lossy (at least my current one pass conversion still is...) and smplayer can't play it right unedited
    only if asked?
  alpha transparent "grey" overlay (for partial parts of the window)
  certain sections: can speed them up, to make them less scary or what not, but you can still see what's happening. Not sure how audio could/should apply here.
  google android TV app/iTV ?
  advertise related bounties to their various groups
  create a really snazzy pro looking website
  the final "edited.avi" really "could/should" be playable in WMP...
  can I use ffmpeg to re-sync audio, and be able to re-play the edited copy, and thus avoid the small but extra harddup overhead (basically "just avoid")?
    I can live with "watching while grabbing" being lack luster...or maybe I can grab it with acodec copy (typically), then reencode it somehow later into something that is friendlier to computer players...or is it encoders?
      appears the only messed up audio one is smplayer...and probably mplayer with DVD's [?]
        do this after frame accurate
  monkey.png is in bin...move it
  better program icon
  @mplayer: seeking to within EDL failz
  can make community overlay "comments" somehow or other/whatever cyberlink does :)
  re-look through all my old "thoughts" notes
  mplayer playlist mode possible, like real playlist?
  add button start EDL playback from dvd here [?] (for create mode)
  re-play as EDL button for both modes--describe on the how to better
  fix prio for first ffmpeg instance not being settable [huh?]
  calculating md5...do this while they choose it [low prio] :)
  @dvd flick: right click on a movie file "write this file to DVD .iso as only title (no menu), burn this file as DVD only title (no menu)" [+- with filters x,y or z]
  @dvd flick: default should not be to loop
  @dvd flick: use first aspect ratio by default.
  check if a newer version of smplayer (+- forum links) can replace raw usage of mplayer now?
  integrate sub-titles-zy-er auto-download (like the Python fella)
    or maybe...use theirs?
  @mplayer: some way to not have to use phreaky phreaky pipes in doze ("+1")
  @ffmpeg: do you get slower the farther into large files you are?
  @ffmpeg: gop 12 for ntsc-dvd?
  can watch conference like a music video :)
    can play "this section then that, with this one's audio
  speedify things (the whole process takes approximately...eternity?)
  show them how to use smplayer with subtitles [video?]
  can overlay with an arbitrary image
  @dvd flick: auto-detect the aspect ratio, if possible (?)
  ffmpeg handle 3F2R audio [sigh] [cars, should work with temple at lavc, too, bob dvd's are dual, I think...hmm...]
  an 'always blank not skip the mutes' option for paranoid
  video on how to use imdb
    if times match all DVD players...
  accomodate alternate endings et al
  @mplayer you *die* with edl's on many DVD's... ex: on bunny one
    vendor\cache\mencoder\mplayer dvdnav://2 -nocache -edl C:\Users\packrd\AppData\Local\Temp\mplayer.temp.edl -dvd-device f:\
  delete fulli file automatically
    except if it's a specific scene run...
  .exe installer
    just unzips, runs the .bat file for them [?] :)
      full msi
  ask if you can somehow more easily grab to "mostly the same" exact codec (ffmpeg, mencoder mailing lists) [blog that you can't]
  add md5 "warning" when something (anything) had failed disc fails doesn't match because of DVD read failure...
  LLC before I ever pay anyone anything, if I ever do
  add some or any of the following "play now" options...without a true navigator of course :)
    visualbasic-like msdvdweb playlist
      one line at a time :P
      provide link for cheap DVD decoder if they lack one :)
    "round conservatively, yes write inaccurate file straight from DVD in pieces" ?
      then I guess they could play that file back immediately...?
    get half-way through (rip, start writing edited copy), then start playing back as continuing to write edited full copy (if windows allows...might have to watch it piece-wise)
    one that's "play DVD to x, now play it muted, now play it to y" (playlist? batch? ms?)
    one that's "rip and save first 20 minutes edited, start me on that, while doing the whole thing..." [?]
      except after 20 minutes you're hosed
    some super spiffy version that can grab and play "both" *on the fly* somehow LOL
      maybe one that is watching the extraction (get info, get info, get info...)...as it includes scene x, it adds it edited to the end of the final output file...
        This seems like the only real way.
    one that's "we're grabbing, but play from that via EDL or playlist against that file as it comes in"
  
  create a how to use screencast
  editing/creating screencast
   instructions on how to do their own (private) DL or do one and submit it (public), or email their friends :P
      add an option "just save full disk (unedited) to hard drive..."
        note to people: can edit these to your liking, resubmit
  DRY up dependency installation' code
  "Re-run most recent" disabled when there isn't one [?]
  can rip from a DVD-like local folder (would anybody ever need this?)
  can parse IMDB
    add stuffs to imdb hmmm
    IMDB easy DVD mapping...
  can blank out the video, with audio continuing through...
  @VLC: hard crash when ripping that one DVD...long one, about the constitution...
    can use a fast temp drive, save through it to another :P
      (when they have two...)
  blu-ray support somehow (OCR maybe)
  double buffering hard drive/incoming copying from DVD might speed things, if your HD is fast.
    might not work for all modes tho...
  make the progress bar map "better" to the actual time that each section should take...

  @ffmpeg: rip to fulli mpeg -> ffmpeg -ovc copy -oac copy out.mpg -> no audio!
     and to .avi sometimes works, sometimes it results in static!

  can lop off sections/screen coords to save disk space (?)

@smplayer: right click on DVD...
the ac3 thing (I have to specify it...is this necessary? is it always ac3?) [basically, can I copy audio again?]
make it so it can have different volume settings, like low volume instead of just always 0
DVD's: right click on DVD player, play with SC
an auto-check for "newer version available" automagically not...
warn when labels both exist but don't match...

@avidemux: don't shtink with DVD files: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=10822953#post10822953
@mplayer warn before overwrite
@mplayer you cannot convert mkv files correctly you silly!

== random non-DVD backlog ... or never do DVD. note: just plow forward, to "grab" available ideas...except that for now, just what *I* plan on needing for myself (filters for what I need/want). ==

Also things skip-worthy include The prefix/endfix of Netflix
series' that they run together( ex: Dr. Who has 4 episodes in a row, with 4 jarring
main-title themes between them all.)   This type of thing

timing all dogs go to heaven--way off in hulu? huh?
some low level frame hijacker for incoming cable movies, too? ... hmm...

misses digits: youtube friday somewhere along there...40 or so [or maybe it got them fine actually...]

can synchronize hulu/netflix instant play, for girlfriends
create avisynth realtime EDL'er

when mouse jerks the "first" time--don't count it!  It's the next transition that matters..I think so...
  or count it as "worst possible" ?

@mplayer: why you can't play some sound files when VLC can? huh? (audio sync) (mpeg issues, probably...yikes mplayer...could file a bounty for us maybe? inquity?)
advertise my "splitting joining" google doc page. also test the other various options there for accurateness :)
use voice recognition for profanity [?]
take out use_class_name for descriptors

after 2020: DVD Navigator in C++ ?

it should track "is paused" better (OCR)

something that works with cable TV, too, somehow?
figure out why I need to uses dvdnav:// sometimes, dvd:// others to not crash :P

if sued, could use straight mplayer -ss (+- one at a time, or possibly in a playlist [?] like VLC can...)
  -hr-edl-seek ?

fade in/fade out volume, video
make the other stuff work again, since I no longer use YAML...

pass all unit tests again jruby

speed up slow unit tests
make the overlay window uncloseable (?)
note that youtube can be downloaded then a local edited copy created, from that download. (mb add downloading ability?)
screencast of things helpful (use, creation...).
tune up the levels...
prototypes of the experimental stuff (overlay, track time while recording -> map file, specifiable levels, more?)

fix:
  0:01:01.9 next will be at 0:01:02.0s (r [or q to quit]):
  0:01:04.0 next will be at 0:01:06.5s (blanked) (r [or q to quit]): "warning--unable to track screen time for some reason" # *of course you can't track it now!*

byu.tv descriptor
youtube non full screen: work with all browsers
easier "here's how on the command line, BTW"
amazon player
a netflix player descriptor
  "just choose VLCx55" LOL

Just fold if s....

a descriptor for some closed source app player...

can "overlay-audio/video"

blanker: allow for one side of the screen or another...

PISH
  release it with both until scared (?)
  split projects when scared (editor versus normal)/make projects work with direct editing, et al...
    split online from DVD, et al
  Note: get the whole thing working then release it all :P

check that youtube is working well again for all screen resolutions...

run it off a normal person (hulu, DVD). rinse and repeat

advertise on ruby flow

"ripperzy-ize" (low prio)
    can record from online [huh? do I even want this?]
      maybe can record something, then extract the bad...
      low prio
      remove commercials?

DRY up :levels--it's in the ocr spec as well as the others...

unit tests run with normal ruby

back off on mouse jerking...only every so often?
  maybe increase timings as you get farther along, to accomodate for drift?

preference for beeping at them, et al

itunes video on demand player

blockbuster "rent" on demand player

no money making for now...all volunteer...more respectful.
  or make it so it can work with an editor of some kind...like a "save here" command line snip this tuck that.
    probably only possible after creating the desktop streamer hmm

no releasing experimental for now, I guess

integrate with librivox' audio so you can avoid profanity in classics.  Somehow.  This would be nice for portable players.
  You know, for static things like this, a 'pre-cutter' would sure be convenient...
  provide download of edited mp3's for people.  ahhh.
  
itunes player for profanity (music)?

make a list of "known clean" movies...hmm...

an "online anybody can chat while watching this movie" (or anybody can edit this wav and listen to it as overlay...) prefer the latter.

an online applet web runnable? Why not?
  click here to watch your favorite film edited on hulu! Just click! [* yea!]
  
code refactors: "screen time change", order should be swapped in bin/x output (just cleanup)

easier installation for windows: self-extracting exe's :)
  later: .msi?

can blank overlay with added text like "and you are one awesome klingon"

ability to record it from online/live, then apply edits.

add my stuff to imdb...? make a wiki?

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", or "boring level x"

with VLC/youtube non full screen, it does the annoying mouse thing needlessly (which doesn't bug as much these days...)

can overlay with wav file (would work already for VLC [?], could also "click to mute" for others...hmm...)

the muting currently is so togglesy...if VLC ever fixes itself, fix this! 

fix any/all pending tests...

can permanently black out certain coords to keep things prettier...et al
  remove black when they really move the mouse?

Linux port (call that good enough for usability on TV's...), should be...
  OS X port

blanker outer with user specifiable color
  better default color?

Auto mute/blank commercials?

transfer ownership to a single LLC
  new github username
  new domains
  new sourceforge with that email
  new youtube

overlay/replace current playback with some url of audio or video
  user editable joke overlays (like a wiki...)
  realtime overlays (like group chat for those watching the film...)

control volume programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control mute programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control location programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.

compare VLC (and other) timings with a real DVD player, and with netflix instant, etc.

Have a "list of all known movies (url's)" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...
  or known parseable imdb's

does my sweet heart have any suggestions? (make it work well for laymen)

web browser plugin?
  popups *inside* netflix "play this edited" ?

Programmatically do all of the above, by driving VLC with libvlc (its API).
  So this would be basically tracking VLC using its libvlc callbacks, instead of screen times
  fork the Python project?
  VLC
    use VLC's web interface? telnet?
    optimize it with best appropriate iframes (LOL)

integrate with google TV...bravia...maybe...somehow...boxxee? roku?
  itunes TV? apple tv? ps3?

--server?  optionally higher prio?

@MRI:

take out all require 'rubygems'ses...

warn them when it looks like screen capture is very painful/expensive [is it too bad anyway, though] ? iff necessary

create a "book edit list" (word x is at position y...)

@dvd flick: 
  are your highest settings optimal?
  accept subtitled video...huh?
  accept multi-audio track videos
  
@smplayer: your CD config is awful.
@mencoder: can't split
something like you watch it *with* you friends and can all chat together...hmm...

do the same, but for books...also optimize them for reading through full volumes...you don't want a summary...don't want the title, know it's librivox...maybe say chapter x, that's it.  Probably start by just editing out the profanity, though :P Also do the Book of Mormon

@mencoder: ripping like this results in an (avidemux, VLC) fourcc of 'ugh':  mencoder2 dvdnav://1  -oac copy -ovc copy -o D:\raw_rip_mpeg_example.avi -endpos 20 -dvd-device E:\

@jruby: system("mencoder") from a button doesn't get interrupted by an exception [!]
@vlc: replay mp4's are too dark.

a DVD burner for ISO, then it can "burn over" some bad sectors? or you can grab an ISO and "null out" just where you wanted to?

maybe require them to rip their stuff "through some means or other" and we'll operate on the product based on an EDL list :) [could be more legal]


@rspec:   
1) EdlParser should raise for end before beginning
     Failure/Error: proc{ go({"mutes"=>{105=>104.9}})}.should raise_error(/SyntaxError/)

give money to nomachine--wow!

a boxee api? 
I *could* record netflix movies, then edit those manually (or mapped-ly)...meh clearplay needs some niche--we don't have each other after all.

create a "map" of VLC DVD timings to "real" timings via tracking.  Hopefully never necessary...
        
if it looks paused I should basically pause my tracking [if it looks nothing, then keep going with my tracking]
it fails on "friday" tracks 0:48 as 1:48
probably at startup should not start at 0, either, wait for first screen trackage
figure out a way to get to the roku [ps3ms?], +- netflix edited to roku LOL
