== medium ==

== low but actually want to do eventually (me) low prio: just do these...==

  generations the first profanidade...
  youtube non full screen...

== random backlog ... based on user request..remember:  just local files for my own needs...==
note: just plow forward, to "grab" available ideas...
  except that for now, just what *I* plan on needing for myself.

code refactors: "screen time change", order should be swapped in bin/x

auto-play on youtube...hmm... (detect)

able to make it "quieter" at certain parts, arbitrarily...

easier installer for windows: release a zip file that they can just click on a .bat file to run it
  later: it installs/uninstalls appropo
    suggestion: self-extractor

snag the close captioning as a profanity filter?

make it able to use multiple players so I can maximize VLC...

blank overlay text like "and you are one awesome klingon"

screencast of things helpful (use, creation).

TSR that monitors "oh you're opening a VLC? you're playing the E drive? That's bob's big plan? You're maximized? Full screened? watching x on hulu?"

a netflix online player description
  
add my stuff to imdb...

an imdb parser?

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", or "boring level x"

make a redcar installer for their use...

can overlay with a "fuzzer-outer" for specific coordinates somehow or other...

advertise like to lay men, to try to popularize

with VLC non full screen, it does the annoying mouse thing needlessly (which doesn't bug as much these days...)

youtube/hulu non full screened...hmmm

overlay with wav file (would work for VLC, could also "click to mute" for the others...)

fix any pending tests...

can black out certain coords to keep things prettier...

allow x2,y2 for player descriptions...

Linux port (call that good enough for usability on TV's...) between that and a VLC version...

a web runnable? Why not?
  click here to watch your favorite film edited! Just click!

blank out with specifiable color
  better default color?

Auto mute/blank commercials?

new github username

replay parts

overlay/replace current playback with some url of audio or video
  user editable overlays (like a wiki...)

control volume programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control mute programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control location programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.

compare timings with a real DVD player...

overlay with an alpha transparent pic

Have a "list of all known movies (url's)" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...

user-assignable "confidence" (how much time to 'wrap' surround the mutes, etc. to accomodate for slow computers/laggy internet/different players/poor input)

does my sweet heart have any suggestions?

auto-assignment of EDL's to media:
  DVD's (right click on DVD player, play with scene-skipper?)
  web browser plugin?
  auto start on DVD insertion (?)
    and show appropriate scene-lists available based on title/md5 of something?

Programmatically do all of the above, by driving a player with its real API.
  VLC
    Allow it to record to mp4's somewhere (recordable)
     burnable to DVD/CD ...
     (use VLC's web interface?)
    
use spiffy differentiation for DVD's on windows

super easy streamer windows -> {XBOX360, wii, etc..} basically like playon, which appears to have no free equivalent, I guess, though you can 
  save the files somewhere and stream them (and stream DVD's [?]) using tversity...maybe some other things...hmm...but no netflix!
  so currently they basically need to run a cable from laptop to PC, for me.  windows laptop, for netflix, though a dedicated box could run things like boxee.
  so I could create something that's basically windows -> ??? (ushare).  
  For now it's either a cable, a computer (with its cable), or pay.
  todo: make a VLC wrapper so it works *if your soundcard supports it*
    after: make the same work awesome on doze 7 without soundcard support :)
