== roadmap [for just tasks, see below though] == 

  remember this stuff is all "oh gosh I have to do that too?" crud time, don't even want it.
    and "won't even be useful to people in the end so why bother?"
    "just for fun"
    
  netflix instant EDL go live/mac'ify
  
  then roadmap_possibilities
  
== high prio like blocking bugs ==
  
== things working on today/requested ==
  
== yes do ordered for this release/other projects ja  ==
  virtual audio re-release
  auto-start audio caster ability, just use jruby/mklink LOL
  bug on reload EDL apparently
  it doesn't allow you to switch disk's, hit play again, currently.
  it can "overlay display" custom edited .srt files
  
== yes do, un-ordered currently, from all the various future release options ==
  
  can use zoomplayer, prompt them "do you want to..." and if yes add single button for play current DVD with zoom :P
  add "create for non-DVD" button :) [dropdown netflix/hulu/file LOL]
  my mplayer can't seek arrow keys os x?
  genealogy screen saver create/publicize
  mac: distros that I can just download, unzip for ffmpeg, mplayer-edl, advertise urug
  upconvert stuff @home/sintel
    (no non-de-dupe)
  the timestamp sync'ing feels broken it's hard to use LOL
    srt add option "pick coordinating one from the middle, or from the end[which might have more spoilers]"
    needs option "test it out starting near there" or the like
    needs to at *least* parse it for them
  can write synchronized euphemized srt
  add option "just skip don't mute always instead of muting"

  ffmpeg how to add subs demo
  inspector general
  remove splits' old functionality 
  add 0.25 only in "normal" mode to end of skips...I guess...if they came from file mode anyway...
    theoretically add 0 in normal mode, for the pedantic...make it a preference I guess :P
  the "lined" "select this one" quality editor...
  user preference "always just skip" if that's what he wanted :P
  super precise timing, this 1.001 just doesn't cut it
  gui/edl parser unit tests work
    added an extra "show" perhaps? EXIT_ON_CLOSE [?]
  double check if sampleDvd and HPC/PowerDvd are really inconsistent like I believe they are.
    is powerdvd off by exactly 0.5s (rounds up)?
    C player:
      double check if it timing shucks, though I think it does...
        also what happens if I hit "next frame" over and over and over? does it get behind then? huh?
  use DVD NAV packet time:
    timestamps_relative_to "force them" to have, or to hit the upgrade button
    add 2 options: file, "dvd"
    update wiki
    timestamps_relative_to => "dvd"
    remove -osd-add, or maybe fine tune it?
    add OSD time to the console output
    non 29.97 with mplayer edl change OSD
    "static" mplayer-edl for OS X :P
    add a migrate button, prompts for "file" versus DVD

  a true overlapping mute type failure when you hit the "watch edited realtime" should popup.
    also if they're "close" but not overlapping [ex: contiguous] they should just combine

  certain sections: can speed them up, to make them less scary or what not, but you can still see what's happening. Not sure how audio could/should apply here.
  advertise related bounties to their various groups
  create a really snazzy pro looking website
  can I use ffmpeg to re-sync audio, and be able to re-play the edited copy, and thus avoid the small but extra harddup overhead (basically "just avoid")?
    I can live with "watching while grabbing" being lack luster...or maybe I can grab it with acodec copy (typically), then reencode it somehow later into something that is friendlier to computer players...or is it encoders?
      appears the only messed up audio one is smplayer...and probably mplayer with DVD's [?]
        do this after frame accurate

    one that's "play DVD to x, now play it muted, now play it to y" (playlist? batch? ms?)
    one that's "rip and save first 20 minutes edited, start me on that, while doing the whole thing..." [?]
      except after 20 minutes you're hosed
    some super spiffy version that can grab and play "both" *on the fly* somehow LOL
      maybe one that is watching the extraction (get info, get info, get info...)...as it includes scene x, it adds it edited to the end of the final output file...
        This seems like the only real way.
    one that's "we're grabbing, but play from that via EDL or playlist against that file as it comes in"
  
  create a how to use screencast
  editing/creating screencast
   instructions on how to do their own (private) DL or do one and submit it (public), or email their friends :P
      add an option "just save full disk (unedited) to hard drive..."
        note to people: can edit these to your liking, resubmit
  "Re-run most recent" disabled when there isn't one [?]
  can rip from a DVD-like local folder (would anybody ever need this?)
  can blank out the video, with audio continuing through...
  can use a fast temp drive, save through it to another :P
    (when they have two...)
  double buffering hard drive/incoming copying from DVD might speed things, if your HD is fast.
    might not work for all modes tho...
  make the progress bar map "better" to the actual time that each section should take...

  @ffmpeg: rip to fulli mpeg -> ffmpeg -ovc copy -oac copy out.mpg -> no audio!
     and to .avi sometimes works, sometimes it results in static!

  can lop off sections/screen coords to save disk space (?)

@smplayer: right click on DVD...
the ac3 thing (I have to specify it...is this necessary? is it always ac3?) [basically, can I copy audio again?]
make it so it can have different volume settings, like low volume instead of just always 0
an auto-check for "newer version available" automagically not...
warn when labels both exist and don't match...

@mplayer warn before overwrite
@mplayer you cannot convert mkv files correctly you silly! (ffmpeg too?)

== random non-DVD/OCR backlog ... or a few never do DVD. ==

auto-mute during hulu commercials [annoying!] LOL

@mplayer: you return the wrong return code, sillys! https://gist.github.com/1056292
@smplayer: me fix: their timestamp for dvdnav
Also things skip-worthy include The prefix/endfix of Netflix
series' that they run together( ex: Dr. Who has 4 episodes in a row, with 4 jarring
main-title themes between them all.)   This type of thing

some low level frame hijacker for incoming cable movies, too? ... hmm...
  not hijacker, but monitor to detect location/position

can accidentally die when doesn't start well:

can synchronize hulu/netflix instant play, for girlfriends
create avisynth realtime EDL'er

when mouse jerks the "first" time--don't count the next reading!  It's the next transition that matters..I think so...
  or count it as "worst possible"?
  it's off by up to 1s, at the least...hmm...

@mplayer: why you can't play some sound files when VLC can? huh? (audio sync) (mpeg issues, probably...yikes mplayer...could file a bounty for us maybe? inquity?)
advertise my "splitting joining" google doc page. also test the other various options there for accurateness :)
use voice recognition for profanity [?]
take out use_class_name for descriptors

if s..., could use straight mplayer -ss (+- one at a time, or possibly in a playlist [?] like VLC can...)
  or just file based

fade in/fade out volume, video, instead of just hard muting it as it does currently, or hard overlay blanking it, or skipping.
make the other stuff work again, since I no longer use YAML...

speed up slow unit tests
make the overlay window uncloseable (?)
note that youtube can be downloaded then a local edited copy created, from that download. (mb add downloading ability?)
screencast of things helpful (use, creation...).
tune up the levels...
prototypes of the experimental stuff (overlay, track time while recording -> map file, specifiable levels, more?)

fix:
  0:01:01.9 next will be at 0:01:02.0s (r [or q to quit]):
  0:01:04.0 next will be at 0:01:06.5s (blanked) (r [or q to quit]): "warning--unable to track screen time for some reason" # *of course you can't track it now!*

byu.tv descriptor
youtube non full screen: work with all browsers
amazon player
"just choose VLCx55" LOL

Just fold if s....

can "overlay-audio/video"

blanker: allow for one side of the screen or another...

PISH
  release it with both until scared (?)
  split projects when scared (editor versus normal)/make projects work with direct editing, et al...
    split online from DVD, et al
  Note: get the whole thing working then release it all :P

check that youtube is working well again for all screen resolutions...

advertise on ruby flow

DRY up :levels--it's in the ocr spec as well as the others...

back off on mouse jerking...only every so often?
  maybe increase timings as you get farther along, to accomodate for drift?

preference for beeping at them if it is failing to track, or when done with a conversion, et al

itunes video on demand player descriptor

blockbuster "rent on demand" player descriptor

no money making for now...all volunteer...more respectful.
  or make it so it can work with an editor of some kind...like a "save here" command line snip this tuck that.
    probably only possible after creating the desktop streamer hmm

integrate with librivox' audio so you can avoid profanity in classics.  Somehow.  This would be nice for portable players.
  You know, for static things like this, a 'pre-cutter' would sure be convenient...
  provide download of edited mp3's for people.  ahhh.
  
itunes player for profanity (music)?

an "online anybody can chat while watching this movie" (or anybody can edit this wav and listen to it as overlay...) prefer the latter.

an online applet web runnable? Why not?
  click here to watch your favorite film edited on hulu! Just click! [* yea!]
  
easier installation for windows: self-extracting exe's :)
  later: .msi?

can blank overlay with specifiable text like "and you are one awesome klingon"

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", and/oor "boring level x or greater"

with VLC/youtube non full screen, it does the annoying mouse thing needlessly (which doesn't bug as much these days...)

the muting currently is so togglesy...if VLC ever fixes itself, fix this! 


blanker outer with user specifiable color
  better default color?

Can auto mute/blank/skip  commercials?

transfer ownership to a single LLC
  new github username
  new domains
  new sourceforge with that email
  new youtube

overlay/replace current playback with some url of audio or video
  user editable joke overlays (like a wiki...)
  realtime overlays (like group chat for those watching the film...)

Have a "list of all known movies (url's)" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...

does my sweet heart have any suggestions? (make it work well for laymen)

integrate with google TV...bravia...maybe...somehow...boxxee? roku?
  itunes TV? apple tv? ps3?
  probably via broadcast...

take out all various require 'rubygems'ses...

warn them when it looks like screen capture is very painful/expensive [is it too bad anyway, though] ? iff necessary

create a "book edit list" (word x is at position y...)

@dvd flick: 
  are your highest settings optimal?
  accept subtitled video...huh?
  accept multi-audio track videos
  
@smplayer: your CD config is awful.
@mencoder: can't split
something like you watch it *with* you friends and can all chat together...hmm...

do the same, but for audio books...also optimize them for reading through full volumes...you don't want a summary...don't want the title, know it's librivox...maybe say chapter x, that's it.  Probably start by just editing out the profanity, though :P Also do the Book of Mormon

@mencoder: ripping like this results in an (avidemux, VLC) fourcc of 'ugh':  mencoder2 dvdnav://1  -oac copy -ovc copy -o D:\raw_rip_mpeg_example.avi -endpos 20 -dvd-device E:\

a DVD burner for ISO, then it can "burn over" some bad sectors? or you can grab an ISO and "null out" just where you wanted to?

maybe require them to rip their stuff "through some means or other" and we'll operate on the product based on an EDL list :) [could be more legal]

a boxee api? 
I *could* record netflix movies, then edit those manually (or mapped-ly)...meh clearplay needs some niche--we don't have each other after all, plus legality

opening youtube, if not already opened, choose chrome in plugin, get this:
RuntimeError: poor width or wrong window 94 1 71
     initialize at c:/dev/ruby/sensible-cinema/lib/screen_tracker.rb:54
  new_from_yaml at c:/dev/ruby/sensible-cinema/lib/screen_tracker.rb:27
          go_sc at bin\sensible-cinema-cli:94
         (root) at bin\sensible-cinema-cli:128
        [hard exit]

create a "map" of VLC DVD timings to "real" timings via tracking.  Hopefully never necessary...
  hopefully I can really fix VLC instead
        
it fails on "friday" it tracks 0:48 as 1:48
probably at startup should not start at 0, either, wait for first screen trackage

can mute for "tense" scenes
