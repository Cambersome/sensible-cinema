OCR

jruby with a nice looking GUI for startup/perferences...
  
Auto mute commercials?

rruby.net rubyy.net

new github username

PIHS

replay certain parts

overlay/replace with some url of audio or video

control volume programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control mute programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.

overlay alpha transparent pic

Have a "list of all known movies (url's)" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...

handle arbitrary seeks that land me in the middle of a bad section :)

don't blip the mutes on and off every second...

resync based on visual/audio (black/blank?)

magnify video parts (?)

resync based on OCR.
  poll or "when there, use it"
  pop it up every so often (?)
    after commercials?

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", or "boring level x"

user-assignable "confidence" (how much time to 'wrap' the mutes, etc.)

auto-assignment of EDL's to media:
  web plugin?
  DVD's
    VLC
    directory of filters

Programmatically do all of the above, by driving using an internal API.
  VLC
    Allow it to make mp4's somewhere.
    See if burnable to DVD.
  auto start on DVD insertion (?)
    and show appropriate filters available based on title/md5 of something?

have some way to stream it to your PC easily/cheaply or what not
  try it with xbmc/boxee/windows media whatever...I guess. Check the experience, anyway :)

  xbox: you have to pay extra for streaming (from your pc)?
  The XBOX plays all the standard file types (BT ones anyway...
  roku seems uneditable
  seems that overlaying "something on doze" is best...
  an original xbox could probably be made to stream from your PC...maybe...I'd wager...hmm...now if it could browse your PC *and* the Internet (XBMC?) that might rock.
  S-video seems popular...but that would cost a monitor...hmm...OK FOR ME...others can figure it out...
  PS3 + tversity?
  apparently there is a *lot* online these days:http://tversity.com/support/premium-websites
  it seems that mine mostly just work on windows, then you'll want to save it off to mpeg (camtastic), then be able to stream it...so I only have to worry about live "on computer" playback for now.
  it works "easier" on 'just play it from doze/linux' for me, for now...
