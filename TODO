make work with VLC and hulu with hours...

== low but actually want to do eventually (me) low prio: just do these...==

  release ruby-y-y why not, it's interesting
    "Linux compat anyone?"

  just local files for my own needs

== raw backlog ... based on user request.. ==

netflix
  
add my own stuff to imdb...

imdb parser

make it into a real live full functional app...like fully fully functional and good (for use, not editing), mostly with the drop down lists uh guess.

GUI: paste edit list, choose player

PISH

can overlay with a "fuzzer-outer" for specific coordinates somehow or other...

advertise like to lay men

with VLC non full screen, it does the annoying mouse thing needlessly.

hire out scene lists

youtube non full screened...hmmm

bleeper name

yank old gem versions (?) :)

overlay with wav file (would work for VLC, could also "click to mute" for the others...)

fix pending tests...

can black out certain coords to keep things pretty...

allow x2,y2 for player descriptions...

Linux port (call that good enough for usability on TV's...) between that and a VLC version...

a web runnable? Why not?
  click here to watch your favorite film edited!

blank out with a user specifiable color (?)

Auto mute commercials?

rruby.net rubyy.net

new github username

replay parts

overlay/replace with some url of audio or video

control volume programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control mute programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.

overlay alpha transparent pic

Have a "list of all known movies (url's)" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...

magnify video parts (?)
overlay with transparent gif?

OCR
  pop it up only every so often (?)
    after commercials?

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", or "boring level x"

user-assignable "confidence" (how much time to 'wrap' surround the mutes, etc. to accomodate for slow computers/laggy internet/different players/poor input)

auto-assignment of EDL's to media:
  DVD's
    VLC
    directory of scene-lists
  web plugin?

Programmatically do all of the above, by driving a player with its real API.
  VLC
    Allow it to make mp4's somewhere.
    See if burnable to DVD.
    web interface?
  auto start on DVD insertion (?)
    and show appropriate scene-lists available based on title/md5 of something?
    
could have an easy 
    
never do unless paid:

super easy streamer windows -> {XBOX360, wii, etc..} basically like playon, which appears to have no free equivalent, I guess, though you can 
  save the files somewhere and stream them (and stream DVD's [?]) using tversity...maybe some other things...hmm...but no netflix!
  so currently they basically need to run a cable from laptop to PC, for me.  windows laptop, for netflix, though a dedicated box could run things like boxee.
  so I could create something that's basically windows -> ??? (ushare).  
  For now it's either a cable, a computer (with its cable), or pay.
