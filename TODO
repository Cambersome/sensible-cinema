    add to the template, make it so that various can use it
  a real overlapping mute type failure when you hit the "watch edited realtime" should popup.
  subtitles: if at beginning of a sub, add extra initial offset...hmm...why not?
    and end too why not?
  macify work minor things it doesn't currently :)
  @instructions: full srt how-to document instead of tooltip [?] or combine the two! yes!
  volume_name => dvd_volume_label # but what about blu-ray?

  @mplayer: if you play just dvdnav://1 from start to finish, it goes until 60 seconds into the menu *after* title 1 finishes

  @mplayer the cross compile instructions are owd

  add custom profanity option
  you can mark where the starts and stop are, then hit a button 'test my latest marks' and then edit them and retest...more easily, that is
  add "play at 1.5x speed" mplayer button, I guess
  screencast for creating using srt [after it's user friendly?]
  linearize: full EDL with JSON on top, full timestamps. or something I like...
  test DVD upconv it at 720*x resolution too...
  they need/want to realize it's for contribution, not just use...
    ooh here's a good idea.  
    force them to create any new EDL's on the wiki, and just read them, always, straight from there.
    or some online gui thing, that would work too...prefer the latter

    also are they 30fps or not? and how do they handle timesplits?
    is there another format that will actually mute?
    XBMC mode doesn't mind the 600 starting offset...
      oh wait we weren't even using it right to begin with LOL
      plus it needs to "always just skip instead of mute" for now I guess
      report XBMC bugs, too.
  research VOB dirs
    still needs timesplits? what about in XBMC? what about XBMC with DVD's
  @avisynth: 6 fps from 2? huh? also why are some progs [ffmpeg] seemingly resetting the graphedit pins? huh? also tell that one already logged bug how I work around it...

  fast preview: change it to be aggressive sometimes yes, other times no
  fast preview mode: watch for modifications to file, kill mplayer instances for them on change :)
  fast preview tends to "go too far" [like the end of profanity is still there when played via the "real way"]
  note to them [in how_to_create]: can do the two types of preview at same time...concurrently...to save time...

  note that I might be able to make a half and half player that just "sleeps"...if I can get the timing just right...(is this what mplayer does)
  don't exit if a timestamps has same beginning as end, but do warn (is this a problem still?)
  mpeg is lossy (at least my current one pass conversion still is...) and smplayer can't play it right unedited
    only if asked?
  certain sections: can speed them up, to make them less scary or what not, but you can still see what's happening. Not sure how audio could/should apply here.
  advertise related bounties to their various groups
  create a really snazzy pro looking website
  can I use ffmpeg to re-sync audio, and be able to re-play the edited copy, and thus avoid the small but extra harddup overhead (basically "just avoid")?
    I can live with "watching while grabbing" being lack luster...or maybe I can grab it with acodec copy (typically), then reencode it somehow later into something that is friendlier to computer players...or is it encoders?
      appears the only messed up audio one is smplayer...and probably mplayer with DVD's [?]
        do this after frame accurate

  ffmpeg handle 3F2R audio [sigh] [cars, should work with temple at lavc, too, bob dvd's are dual, I think...hmm...]
  an 'always blank not skip the mutes' option for hard core
  video on how to use imdb wiki
  accomodate alternate endings et al
  .exe installer
    just unzips, runs the .bat file for them [?] :)
      full msi
  LLC before I ever pay anyone anything, if I ever do
  add some or any of the following "play now" options...without a true navigator of course :)
    "round conservatively, yes write inaccurate file straight from DVD in pieces" ?
      then I guess they could play that file back immediately...?
    get half-way through (rip, start writing edited copy), then start playing back as continuing to write edited full copy (if windows allows...might have to watch it piece-wise)
    one that's "play DVD to x, now play it muted, now play it to y" (playlist? batch? ms?)
    one that's "rip and save first 20 minutes edited, start me on that, while doing the whole thing..." [?]
      except after 20 minutes you're hosed
    some super spiffy version that can grab and play "both" *on the fly* somehow LOL
      maybe one that is watching the extraction (get info, get info, get info...)...as it includes scene x, it adds it edited to the end of the final output file...
        This seems like the only real way.
    one that's "we're grabbing, but play from that via EDL or playlist against that file as it comes in"
  
  create a how to use screencast
  editing/creating screencast
   instructions on how to do their own (private) DL or do one and submit it (public), or email their friends :P
      add an option "just save full disk (unedited) to hard drive..."
        note to people: can edit these to your liking, resubmit
  "Re-run most recent" disabled when there isn't one [?]
  can rip from a DVD-like local folder (would anybody ever need this?)
  can blank out the video, with audio continuing through...
  can use a fast temp drive, save through it to another :P
    (when they have two...)
  double buffering hard drive/incoming copying from DVD might speed things, if your HD is fast.
    might not work for all modes tho...
  make the progress bar map "better" to the actual time that each section should take...

  @ffmpeg: rip to fulli mpeg -> ffmpeg -ovc copy -oac copy out.mpg -> no audio!
     and to .avi sometimes works, sometimes it results in static!

  can lop off sections/screen coords to save disk space (?)

@smplayer: right click on DVD...
the ac3 thing (I have to specify it...is this necessary? is it always ac3?) [basically, can I copy audio again?]
make it so it can have different volume settings, like low volume instead of just always 0
an auto-check for "newer version available" automagically not...
warn when labels both exist and don't match...

@mplayer warn before overwrite
@mplayer you cannot convert mkv files correctly you silly!

== random non-DVD/OCR backlog ... or a few never do DVD. ==

auto-mute during hulu commercials [annoying!]
fix the audio timestamps for my capturer...

@mplayer: you return the wrong return code, sillys! https://gist.github.com/1056292
@smplayer: bounty or me fix: their for their display [if they use get_time_pos isn't that enough ?]
  @mplayer is it really too slow [link], and there thus no hope for EDL working right? maybe it could change to be based off the get_time_pos ?
Also things skip-worthy include The prefix/endfix of Netflix
series' that they run together( ex: Dr. Who has 4 episodes in a row, with 4 jarring
main-title themes between them all.)   This type of thing

some low level frame hijacker for incoming cable movies, too? ... hmm...
  not hijacker, but monitor to detect location/position

can die when doesn't start well:

can synchronize hulu/netflix instant play, for girlfriends
create avisynth realtime EDL'er

when mouse jerks the "first" time--don't count the next reading!  It's the next transition that matters..I think so...
  or count it as "worst possible"?
  it's off by up to 1s, at the least...hmm...

@mplayer: why you can't play some sound files when VLC can? huh? (audio sync) (mpeg issues, probably...yikes mplayer...could file a bounty for us maybe? inquity?)
advertise my "splitting joining" google doc page. also test the other various options there for accurateness :)
use voice recognition for profanity [?]
take out use_class_name for descriptors

if sued, could use straight mplayer -ss (+- one at a time, or possibly in a playlist [?] like VLC can...)
  -hr-edl-seek ?

fade in/fade out volume, video, instead of just hard muting it as it does currently, or hard overlay blanking it, or skipping.
make the other stuff work again, since I no longer use YAML...

pass all unit tests again jruby

speed up slow unit tests
make the overlay window uncloseable (?)
note that youtube can be downloaded then a local edited copy created, from that download. (mb add downloading ability?)
screencast of things helpful (use, creation...).
tune up the levels...
prototypes of the experimental stuff (overlay, track time while recording -> map file, specifiable levels, more?)

fix:
  0:01:01.9 next will be at 0:01:02.0s (r [or q to quit]):
  0:01:04.0 next will be at 0:01:06.5s (blanked) (r [or q to quit]): "warning--unable to track screen time for some reason" # *of course you can't track it now!*

byu.tv descriptor
youtube non full screen: work with all browsers
amazon player
"just choose VLCx55" LOL

Just fold if s....

can "overlay-audio/video"

blanker: allow for one side of the screen or another...

PISH
  release it with both until scared (?)
  split projects when scared (editor versus normal)/make projects work with direct editing, et al...
    split online from DVD, et al
  Note: get the whole thing working then release it all :P

check that youtube is working well again for all screen resolutions...

advertise on ruby flow

DRY up :levels--it's in the ocr spec as well as the others...

unit tests run with normal ruby

back off on mouse jerking...only every so often?
  maybe increase timings as you get farther along, to accomodate for drift?

preference for beeping at them, et al

itunes video on demand player description

blockbuster "rent" on demand player description

no money making for now...all volunteer...more respectful.
  or make it so it can work with an editor of some kind...like a "save here" command line snip this tuck that.
    probably only possible after creating the desktop streamer hmm

integrate with librivox' audio so you can avoid profanity in classics.  Somehow.  This would be nice for portable players.
  You know, for static things like this, a 'pre-cutter' would sure be convenient...
  provide download of edited mp3's for people.  ahhh.
  
itunes player for profanity (music)?

an "online anybody can chat while watching this movie" (or anybody can edit this wav and listen to it as overlay...) prefer the latter.

an online applet web runnable? Why not?
  click here to watch your favorite film edited on hulu! Just click! [* yea!]
  
easier installation for windows: self-extracting exe's :)
  later: .msi?

can blank overlay with specifiable text like "and you are one awesome klingon"

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", and/oor "boring level x or greater"

with VLC/youtube non full screen, it does the annoying mouse thing needlessly (which doesn't bug as much these days...)

the muting currently is so togglesy...if VLC ever fixes itself, fix this! 


blanker outer with user specifiable color
  better default color?

Can auto mute/blank/skip  commercials?

transfer ownership to a single LLC
  new github username
  new domains
  new sourceforge with that email
  new youtube

overlay/replace current playback with some url of audio or video
  user editable joke overlays (like a wiki...)
  realtime overlays (like group chat for those watching the film...)

Have a "list of all known movies (url's)" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...

does my sweet heart have any suggestions? (make it work well for laymen)

integrate with google TV...bravia...maybe...somehow...boxxee? roku?
  itunes TV? apple tv? ps3?
  probably via broadcast...

take out all various require 'rubygems'ses...

warn them when it looks like screen capture is very painful/expensive [is it too bad anyway, though] ? iff necessary

create a "book edit list" (word x is at position y...)

@dvd flick: 
  are your highest settings optimal?
  accept subtitled video...huh?
  accept multi-audio track videos
  
@smplayer: your CD config is awful.
@mencoder: can't split
something like you watch it *with* you friends and can all chat together...hmm...

do the same, but for audio books...also optimize them for reading through full volumes...you don't want a summary...don't want the title, know it's librivox...maybe say chapter x, that's it.  Probably start by just editing out the profanity, though :P Also do the Book of Mormon

@mencoder: ripping like this results in an (avidemux, VLC) fourcc of 'ugh':  mencoder2 dvdnav://1  -oac copy -ovc copy -o D:\raw_rip_mpeg_example.avi -endpos 20 -dvd-device E:\

@jruby: system("mencoder") from a button doesn't get interrupted by an exception [!]
@vlc: replay mp4's are too dark.

a DVD burner for ISO, then it can "burn over" some bad sectors? or you can grab an ISO and "null out" just where you wanted to?

maybe require them to rip their stuff "through some means or other" and we'll operate on the product based on an EDL list :) [could be more legal]

a boxee api? 
I *could* record netflix movies, then edit those manually (or mapped-ly)...meh clearplay needs some niche--we don't have each other after all, plus legality

opening youtube, if not already opened, choose chrome in plugin, get this:
RuntimeError: poor width or wrong window 94 1 71
     initialize at c:/dev/ruby/sensible-cinema/lib/screen_tracker.rb:54
  new_from_yaml at c:/dev/ruby/sensible-cinema/lib/screen_tracker.rb:27
          go_sc at bin\sensible-cinema-cli:94
         (root) at bin\sensible-cinema-cli:128
        [hard exit]

create a "map" of VLC DVD timings to "real" timings via tracking.  Hopefully never necessary...
  hopefully I can really fix VLC instead
        
it fails on "friday" it tracks 0:48 as 1:48
probably at startup should not start at 0, either, wait for first screen trackage
