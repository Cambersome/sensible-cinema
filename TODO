  hulu
    update win32screenshot if necessary

  some scene lists oh baby (hire out?)
 
low but actually want to do eventually (me) low prio:

  PISH
  release ruby-y

  mutes:
    # one hour one minute and a half second to one hour one minute and 1.5s

  GUI: pick your edit list and player

  netflix

  OCR initial functionality only (maybe). Needs it for easy playback, too, really it does.
  with VLC it seemed to barely pick up the wrong picture--it was too low and to the right [?]

  make it into a real live full functional app...like fully fully functional and good (for use, not editing), mostly with the drop down lists uh guess.

== backlog ... based on user request.. ==

advertise

with VLC non full screen, it does the annoying mouse thing.  This is actually quite annoying.

youtube non full screened...hmmm

skene-skipper

yank old gem versions :)

overlay with wav file (would work for VLC, could "learn to mute" for the others...)

fix all pending tests...

can blank out certain coords to keep things pretty...

inline editor? (redcar)

allow x2,y2 for player descriptions...

Linux port (call that good enough for usability on TV's...) between that and a VLC version...

a web runnable? Why not?
  click here to watch your favorite film edited!

release it "Linux compat anyone?"

blank out with a user specifiable color (?)

PIHS

  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", or "boring level x"

user-assignable "confidence" (how much time to 'wrap' the mutes, etc.)

auto-assignment of EDL's to media:
  DVD's

  VLC
    Allow it to make mp4's somewhere.
    See if burnable to DVD.
    web interface?
  auto start on DVD insertion (?)
    and show appropriate scene-lists available based on title/md5 of something?
