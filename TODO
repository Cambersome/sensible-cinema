OCR (higher prio if it becomes necessary...)

jruby with a nice GUI...

can blank appropo (overlay black screen)
  
user specificable coordinates for the time

After commercials resync automagically...

Auto mute commercials?

rruby.net rubyy.net

new github username

PIHS

overlay a black screen

an easy easy creator...

"a method of controlling the input devices to control the player and coerce the movie from one time point to another" (drag)

"a method of controlling the input devices to control the player and change volume"

"a method of applying OCR to the existing film to extrapolate position in the media"

  replace
  MST 3000
overlay/replace with some url of audio or video
control volume programmatically on the player it self.

overlay alpha transparent pic

Use audio to auto synchronize across different players, or to re-synchronize...

Have a "list of all known movies" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...

Be able to have arbitrary user-programmable "do this recorded movement at this time"

handle arbitrary seeks to the middle of a blank section :)

resync based on visual/audio (black/blank?)

handle ads somehow

magnify parts (?)

a way to play it back just songs?

resync based on OCR.
  poll and "when there, use it"
  pop it up every so often (?)
    after commercials?

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", or "boring level x"

user-assignable "confidence" (how much time to 'wrap' the mutes, etc.)

auto-assignment of EDL's to media:
  web plugin?
  DVD's
    VLC
    directory of filters

Programmatically do all of the above, by driving using an internal API.  Allow it to make mp4's somewhere.
  WMP?
  auto start (?)
  skip intros ?
  insert deleted scenes
