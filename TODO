== medium ==

  amazon player

== probably next up/low prio ==

  better timing for the saving thing...
  byu.tv descriptor
  back off on mouse jerking if they're movin' it
  speed up unit tests
  a netflix player descriptor
  "just choose VLCx55" LOL
    beep at them when not tracking [?]
      default on...hmm

== slightly lower than that ==

  can parse IMDB (require they put in the URL by hand fer now)
    add stuffs to imdb hmmm
  screencast of things helpful (use, creation...).
  can "overplay" (for VLC only on special computers for now :P)
  youtube non full screen: work with other browsers
  easier "here's how on the command line, BTW"

== random backlog ... note: just plow forward, to "grab" available ideas...except that for now, just what *I* plan on needing for myself (filters for what I need/want). ==

a "big download" of the whole thing (so that people can actually use it without pain...batch file even would probably work splendidly...

leaner gem (size-wise...) but I guess some ability to have a zip downloader...hmm...

GUI:
 preferences for levels, etc.

blanker: allow for one side of the screen or another...

PISH
  release it with both until scared (?)
  split projects when scared (editor versus normal)/make projects work with direct editing, et al...
    split online from DVD, et al
  Note: get the whole thing working then release it all :P

check that youtube is working well again for all screen resolutions...

run it off a normal person (hulu, DVD). rinse and repeat

advertise on ruby flow

"ripperzy-ize"
    can record from online [huh? do I even want this?]
      maybe can record something, then extract the bad, and get a better looking video...
      low prio
    research this "record netflix" et al
    and track it as ripping, I guess (time -> time...)
    and then able to edit that...
      remove commercials?

DRY up the levels--it's in the ocr spec as well as the others...

unit tests pass with normal ruby

screen time change only detected... [unexpected] [rid myself of it]

the stabilization on seconds -> 00 -> minutes++: make optional [?]

when polling for bmp changes, just use two lines ( helpful speed-wise?) 

try new GOCR version...

Do I *need* that other window always up or not? (Get rid of it...only do this after have a real window of my own though, that's always up)

preference for beeping at them, et al

itunes video on demand

blockbuster "rent" on demand, online

a real website

no money making for now...all volunteer...more respectful.
  or make it so it can work with an editor of some kind...like a "save here" command line snip this tuck that.
    probably only possible after creating the desktop streamer hmm

no popularizing it for now, I guess

integrate with librivox' audio so you can avoid profanity in classics.  Somehow.  This would be nice for portable players.
  You know, for static things like this, a 'pre-cutter' would sure be convenient...
  provide download of edited mp3's for people.  ahhh.
  
some type of static 'ok grab it using x, then apply y' oh yeah.  That would rock for the DVD market, really.  Just not the online market.

itunes player for profanity (music)?

make a list of "known clean" movies or what not...hmm...

an "online anybody can chat while watching this movie" (or anybody can edit this wav and listen to it as overlay...) prefer the latter.

blu-ray support somehow (real-time, rip?)

an online applet web runnable? Why not?
  click here to watch your favorite film edited on hulu! Just click! [* yea!]
  a chrome plugin with imdb/community backing :)
  
a known list of "compatible" imdb oners...

code refactors: "screen time change", order should be swapped in bin/x output (just cleanup)

auto-play on detect youtube url access...

easier installer for windows: release a zip file that they can just click on a .bat file to run it
  later: it installs/uninstalls appropo
    suggestion: self-extractor

can blank overlay with added text like "and you are one awesome klingon"

ability to record it from online/live, then apply edits.

TSR that monitors "oh you're opening a VLC? you're playing the E drive? That's bob's big plan? You're maximized? Full screened? watching x on hulu? y on youtube?"

add my stuff to imdb...? wiki?

make youtube work if you have *several* open

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", or "boring level x"

with VLC/youtube non full screen, it does the annoying mouse thing needlessly (which doesn't bug as much these days...)

hulu non full screened descriptor

can overlay with wav file (would work already for VLC [?], could also "click to mute" for others...hmm...)

the muting currently is so togglesy...if VLC ever fixes itself, fix this! 

fix any/all pending tests...

can permanently black out certain coords to keep things prettier...et al
  remove black when they really move the mouse?

Linux port (call that good enough for usability on TV's...), should be...

blanker outer with user specifiable color
  better default color?

Auto mute/blank commercials?

transfer ownership to an LLC
  new github username

overlay/replace current playback with some url of audio or video
  user editable joke overlays (like a wiki...)
  realtime overlays (like group chat for those watching the film...)

control volume programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control mute programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control location programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.

compare VLC (and other) timings with a real DVD player, and with netflix online, etc.

overlay with an alpha transparent pic (?)

Have a "list of all known movies (url's)" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...
  or known parseable imdb's

does my sweet heart have any suggestions? (make it work well for laymen)

some type of one click installer that can setup the registry...

auto-assignment of EDL's to media:
  auto-play option for DVD's (auto-start?)
    use normal differentiation
    use spiffy differentiation for DVD's on windows
  DVD's (right click on DVD player, play with scene-skipper?)
  web browser plugin?

Programmatically do all of the above, by driving VLC with its real API.
  VLC
    Allow it to record somehow (recordable)
     burnable to DVD/CD ...
    use VLC's web interface? telnet?
    optimize it with best appropriate iframes (LOL)

star trek: generations first profanidade...

integrate with google TV/bravia...maybe...somehow...boxxee? roku?
  itunes TV? apple tv?

OCR the captioning as an auto profanity filter? (or perhaps download subtitles to be able to pre-screen), like the python fella does..

make an index of watchable on imdb based on stars (?)

--server?  optionally higher prio?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RiffTrax (possible?)
