  release: cheap/mediumcheap inventionzy
  release: C EDL
  compare netflix/blu-ray timings et al
  
  === loose ordering/eventually ===
    linearize [?] hmm...
    re-update todo/all docu/user feedback etc.
    create web site/api-ify
    LLC
      if...back off to just the ffmpeg (plus an "[A,B]" viewer) only...but for now stick with just DVD playback [?] until people want more...
    no propaganda...
    no auto subtitle downloads...
    fix VLC dvdnav itself +- mplayer DVD EDL
  
== high prio like blocking bugs ==  
  
== under next release specific items: ==
   a "half mute" demo, using volume downs/ups     
      plus one that also overlays an extra audio LOL
   cheap minimize via (probably minimize foreground window/windows API) 
   url -> url inference [hopefully this is cake...]
   can handle multiple dvdid's et al
   VLC "insert foreign missing scene" demo, overlay section with image (mplayer?)

== yes do ordered in conjunction with the above probably ==
  m4m: the play button, "regenerate" admin button, "click here x other arrangements of this hymn"

  tighten splits
  "save to" -> same dir as "get from" yeah
  open EDL can have a rememberable DIR
  @instructions "this is great for comparing srt's, except...when it isn't, then you have to..."
  @instructions: full srt how-to document instead of tooltip [?]
  volume_name => dvd_volume_name
  why is the Sintel's EDL seemingly off?
    ascertain how accurate mplayer EDL is...I guess compared to...umm...something?
      fix discrepancy between EDL mplayer and ffmpeg...maybe a new button "accurate EDL playback"?
      maybe search at end of movies for certain things?
    double check--are my ffmpeg splits really really really the same as mplayer's EDL DVD splits? really?
  check with WME plugins, add instructions, then note in the README "support for x..."
  decide if I want to just use edl's or my fancy-shmancy, or maybe my fancy-shmancy to wrap EDL's?
    don't have to use eval!
    EDL with JSON on top, full timestamps.
  setpriority for several :)
  bring to top after a conversion, and before prompts...
  can auto-use tsmuxer at all [?]

  check if some buttons are now outdated...
  check with blu-ray...do they match timing-wise? sub-title wise?
  donate tsmuxer, mplayer, http://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds, mulder +- [?] smplayer menumeter http://instantitunes.wordpress.com/2010/02/26/use-tsmuxer-on-snow-leopard/

  youtube/hulu timings
  split LLC's website+consumer
    get LLC before a "real" domain name
  employee instructions: watch @ realtime after profanity filter first pass :P  
  @makemkv: timing feels broken weird-like!
    try out libdvdcss + handbrake on the one that was totally broken...is it better?
  clear runnings
    have ben and chris test it out, have it work, then ask about video quality
    me try
  try out disney digital copy
  C player:
    folder, look for title.edl
    use DVD navigator
    just use mplayer EDL syntax, plus a title track (or just detect track change, if long enough, assume... :P) :)

    allow it to "just play from X to Y exactly" ...
    does this line up right/perfect? can it work, at all?
      lodo:
        update its semi-bad error messages...
        show time remaining, too, and less ugly [?]
        can come out of full screen more easily :P
    note pay for XP http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-media-player/plug-ins search for the cheapest
    note to them windows vista/7: use ac3filter [?]
    [A,B] 
  note better to previewer "you are about to preview these specific edits..." ?
  ask for more beta testers for use, ask for more beta testers for creation, too
    rinse and repeat with various ppl
  create a semi-accurate phantom edit EDL

  investigate xbmc dvd edl how do you do that? [+- real dvd]
  fast preview: change it to be aggressive sometimes yes, other times no
  fast preview mode: watch for modifications to file, kill mplayer instances for them on change :)
  fast preview tends to "go too far" [like the end of profanity is still there when played via the "real way"]
  mplayer EDL while grabbing, from grabbed :P
  note to them [in how_to_create]: can do the two types of preview at same time...concurrently...to save time...
  can I make playback more smooth by upping mplayer cache? does smplayer pass it a parameter?
  investigate: can I use zoomplayer max?

    detected an overlap 1397.51 1401.275 mute 1395.474 1397.874 mute
    SyntaxError
  lua VLC EDL plugin? LOL yeah right.
  test with cars-ws (at work), mac (to make sure volume name doesn't have spaces)
  investigate dvdrsbvdl (windows media center edl plugin)
  the distro could be made smaller yet [at least not as many gem deps needed...maybe more possible...]

  @mplayer: crash: http://betterlogic.com/roger/2011/07/mplayer-mac-os-x-woe/
  @mplayer: crash IQ nav, keys dont' work in windows, prolly dvdcss doesn't cache in windows, can't pass parameter in windows LOL
  @mplayer: could you umm...go ahead and support avisynth input pleaz, assuming you don't?
  @mplayer: dvdnav:///e: should play the *menu* please? please? [???]
  @mplayer: that one [IQ? hitchhikers'?] fail fail fail until I used -dvd-device [?] huh?
    try to reproduce...
  @mplayer: do I need -zoom ?
  @smplayer: you don't capture stderr [?] ex -vf scale:1280.0
  @mplayer: http://www.infognition.com/VideoEnhancer/ can I do that through any means LOL?
  @mplayer: gl shucks on windows 7!
  can accept straight ".edl" files too, as my input (?)
  @mplayer: after hitting split DVD sectors, the OSD fraction goes bonkers.
  @mplayer: dump core needs a better message..could use one http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/mplayer-users/2007-February/065420.html
  @mplayer: -edl nonexist should warn [?] also when it hits an EDL sector ouput something plz?
  @mplayer: allow EDL to have full timestamps for ease of editing :)
  youtube videos -> new account name
  add an mencoder convert with mplayer_breaks button :P
    can I just use mencoder -hr-edl-seek (off mpeg) to avoid the fulli phase? please? does it work super-accurately, though, off fulli? off other?
    maybe just under an "advanced" window...
  @mplayer homepage: list mulder's not smplayer's, plz?
    also smplayer advertise more prominently :P
  make this thing load faster: don't require rubygems...uh...faster_require?
  does xbmc need a "convert to 30fps edl" for DVD?
  @xbmc can you call out to another player prog plz?
  @xbmc "command line play this dvd with this EDL" :)
  ask mplayer "could you make the OSD available to smplayer so it can get the right timestamps at least for its display?"
  some way to hide spoilers, like soundtrack adds that ruin the movie for ya...

    auto-downloader based on filename/dvd name/md5 ?
  "media browser" plugin?

  @macports: set notestxt \
  13	    "The MPlayer developers do not believe in making regular releases. \
  14	    You are likely better off using the mplayer-devel port." *before* and after (?) (double check it--would one way work ok? mplayer)
  can I use mplayer's "-edlout" to simplify something something, or maybe I should slave mode mplayer for my own means of the same?
  create real plugins for boxee, XBMC et al
  can "blur out" scenes, or specific pixels on frames, like that guy bleeping out his own profanity just lips plus bleep
  a new button (maybe just in advanced mode?) "play EDL mplayer from file (no transcoding)" [if anybody ever would want/need it--seems related to the new c-based player kind of...?]
  if it doesn't parse a file you choose it annoyingly loops *forever* "error pooping" "error pooping" [?]
  "real" dvdid for blu-ray, can work with them (once I figure out timing info...)
  accept the "user inputable" profanities, based on the DVD (like "thor" or what not...)
  can I train the ps3ms to play a real DVD, with EDL ?
  create an XBMC plugin that auto-searches for...ummm...uh...filters for you? huh? some type of plugin?
    just create the side by side .EDL for various files for people.
  make a mymovies plugin to auto-use EDL's somehow... ?
  an almost rifftrax that...says "here overlay x, change normal volume to 50% during that time..."

  add button "play from exactly here to here" in [mplayer uh guess?] :P
    what does mplayer do with -ss big_number past the end of an end [monster's inc]?
  fix ffmpeg's  Application provided invalid, non monotonically increasing dts to muxer in stream 0: 5940 >= 5940
  @makemkv: wrong title no:Title #0 was added (7 cell(s), 0:14:58)
     Title #1 was added (8 cell(s), 0:14:57), also give us title no's in the dialog :P
  @mencoder you lop off the end somehow (dvd rip)
  @VLC: plugin for EDL maybe? [when opening file/DVD look for .edl file?]
  blu ray timing
    my one, others.  Are they the same as DVD's?  They seem really close...
  pull in information from thetvdb to the GUI app
  create the following EDL: 10 commandments DVD to skip the intro music LOL
  @VLC you lop off the end, somehow, I guess...
  create the "ffmpeg frame accurate" splitter
    sounds like I want to move in that direction, esp. if handbrake ends up being sane
  research the gplv3, add terms. Maybe want real lawyer, even?
  sons of provo "music video" EDL
  it can "slow certain sections down" that might look way cool! LOL
  script powerdvd via keystrokes
  VLC: suggest uservoice
  can I just use mencoder with an EDL parameter to possibly split/join more quickly or something?
  10 minute splits for much faster viewage [edl fast preview seems way too lossy ?]
  port to linux
  "release" it to more developers
    plug.org, more rubyists than urug?
    after OS X confidence :)
  an all online EDL editor
    flash canvas
    OCR?

  do todo.inventionzy.txt all
  an "automatic mplayer split finder" :)
  buy forever strong in italian, compare... :P
  mac version of the C player 
    "just play from X to Y exactly" [?]
  forever strong DVD timestamps [and other?], compare timestamps with amazon VoD, too, also jonah amazon VoD [if desired?]
  take out the extra console window box output :) [scary, and closing it closes SC!]
  auto-feedback on crashes [?]
  publish new version of rdp-win32screenshot, if it ever existed

  accomodate failed deletes [files in use] better than dying with a backtrace
  vendorize ffmpeg, to avoid "scary" warning on install of imagemagick/scary active x
  machine learning for video analysis [?]
  figure out how to auto-crop after grab?
  figure out some way to work with cable providers/iphones/gphones?
  @mplayer: why do you sometimes start with subtitles enabled?
  don't need to include in package rdp-win32screenshot et al for just DVD work...
  bring back batch file mplayer :)
  make my website slightly more "pictures-zy"
  check why out of sync my turn on earth on blacky MPH-HC
    does it with other players...?
  super spiffy editor that tracks timestamps for you for new lines
  create a uservoice/uservoice+
  note that I might be able to make a half and half player that just "sleeps"...if I can get the timing just right...(is this what mplayer does)
  don't exit if a timestamps has same beginning as end, but do warn (is this a problem still?)
  mpeg is lossy (at least my current one pass conversion still is...) and smplayer can't play it right unedited
    only if asked?
  alpha transparent "grey" overlay (for partial parts of the window)
  certain sections: can speed them up, to make them less scary or what not, but you can still see what's happening. Not sure how audio could/should apply here.
  google android TV app/iTV ?
  advertise related bounties to their various groups
  create a really snazzy pro looking website
  can I use ffmpeg to re-sync audio, and be able to re-play the edited copy, and thus avoid the small but extra harddup overhead (basically "just avoid")?
    I can live with "watching while grabbing" being lack luster...or maybe I can grab it with acodec copy (typically), then reencode it somehow later into something that is friendlier to computer players...or is it encoders?
      appears the only messed up audio one is smplayer...and probably mplayer with DVD's [?]
        do this after frame accurate
  better program exe icon
  @mplayer: seeking to within EDL failz
  can make community overlay "comments" somehow or other/whatever cyberlink does :)
  re-look through all my old "thoughts" notes/blogs
  mplayer playlist mode possible, like real playlist?
  add button start EDL playback from dvd here [?] (for create mode)
  fix prio for first ffmpeg instance not being settable [huh?]
  check if a newer version of smplayer (+- forum links) can replace raw usage of mplayer now?
  integrate sub-titles-zy-er auto-download 
    I could integrate discid => hashes => opensubtitles.org 
    http://themoviedb.lighthouseapp.com/projects/17044-themoviedborg/tickets/142
    their mkv player probably does some lookup 'er other...maybe...for dvd's
    I really need to tell tvdb to allow for discid, and/or themoviedb to allow for series'
  @mplayer: some way to not have to use phreaky phreaky pipes in doze ("+1")
  @ffmpeg: gop 12 for ntsc-dvd?
  can watch conference like a music video :)
  can play "this section then that, with this one's audio [wow that is fringey]
  speedify things (the whole process takes approximately...eternity?)
  can overlay with an arbitrary image (I think mencoder can actually do this...)
  ffmpeg handle 3F2R audio [sigh] [cars, should work with temple at lavc, too, bob dvd's are dual, I think...hmm...]
  an 'always blank not skip the mutes' option for paranoid
  video on how to use imdb wiki
  accomodate alternate endings et al
  @mplayer you *die* with edl's on many DVD's... ex: on bunny one
    vendor\cache\mencoder\mplayer dvdnav://2 -nocache -edl C:\Users\packrd\AppData\Local\Temp\mplayer.temp.edl -dvd-device f:\
  .exe installer
    just unzips, runs the .bat file for them [?] :)
      full msi
  LLC before I ever pay anyone anything, if I ever do
  add some or any of the following "play now" options...without a true navigator of course :)
    "round conservatively, yes write inaccurate file straight from DVD in pieces" ?
      then I guess they could play that file back immediately...?
    get half-way through (rip, start writing edited copy), then start playing back as continuing to write edited full copy (if windows allows...might have to watch it piece-wise)
    one that's "play DVD to x, now play it muted, now play it to y" (playlist? batch? ms?)
    one that's "rip and save first 20 minutes edited, start me on that, while doing the whole thing..." [?]
      except after 20 minutes you're hosed
    some super spiffy version that can grab and play "both" *on the fly* somehow LOL
      maybe one that is watching the extraction (get info, get info, get info...)...as it includes scene x, it adds it edited to the end of the final output file...
        This seems like the only real way.
    one that's "we're grabbing, but play from that via EDL or playlist against that file as it comes in"
  
  create a how to use screencast
  editing/creating screencast
   instructions on how to do their own (private) DL or do one and submit it (public), or email their friends :P
      add an option "just save full disk (unedited) to hard drive..."
        note to people: can edit these to your liking, resubmit
  "Re-run most recent" disabled when there isn't one [?]
  can rip from a DVD-like local folder (would anybody ever need this?)
  can parse IMDB parental guide
    add stuffs to imdb hmmm
    IMDB easy DVD mapping...
  can blank out the video, with audio continuing through...
  can use a fast temp drive, save through it to another :P
    (when they have two...)
  blu-ray support somehow (OCR maybe)
  double buffering hard drive/incoming copying from DVD might speed things, if your HD is fast.
    might not work for all modes tho...
  make the progress bar map "better" to the actual time that each section should take...

  @ffmpeg: rip to fulli mpeg -> ffmpeg -ovc copy -oac copy out.mpg -> no audio!
     and to .avi sometimes works, sometimes it results in static!

  can lop off sections/screen coords to save disk space (?)

@smplayer: right click on DVD...
the ac3 thing (I have to specify it...is this necessary? is it always ac3?) [basically, can I copy audio again?]
make it so it can have different volume settings, like low volume instead of just always 0
an auto-check for "newer version available" automagically not...
warn when labels both exist and don't match...

@mplayer warn before overwrite
@mplayer you cannot convert mkv files correctly you silly!
bounty dvdnav
  fix dvdnav stuffs?

== random non-DVD/OCR backlog ... or never do DVD. ==

@mplayer: you return the wrong return code, sillys! https://gist.github.com/1056292
@smplayer: bounty or me fix: their for their display [if they use get_time_pos isn't that enough ?]
  @mplayer is it really too slow [link], and there thus no hope for EDL working right? maybe it could change to be based off the get_time_pos ?
Also things skip-worthy include The prefix/endfix of Netflix
series' that they run together( ex: Dr. Who has 4 episodes in a row, with 4 jarring
main-title themes between them all.)   This type of thing

timing all dogs go to heaven--way off in hulu? huh?
some low level frame hijacker for incoming cable movies, too? ... hmm...

when mouse jerks the "first" time--don't count it!  It's the next transition that matters..I think so...
  or count it as "worst possible" ?

@mplayer: why you can't play some sound files when VLC can? huh? (audio sync) (mpeg issues, probably...yikes mplayer...could file a bounty for us maybe? inquity?)
advertise my "splitting joining" google doc page. also test the other various options there for accurateness :)
use voice recognition for profanity [?]
take out use_class_name for descriptors

after 2020: DVD Navigator in C++ ?

it should track "is paused" better (OCR)

something that works with cable TV, too, somehow?

if sued, could use straight mplayer -ss (+- one at a time, or possibly in a playlist [?] like VLC can...)
  -hr-edl-seek ?

fade in/fade out volume, video
make the other stuff work again, since I no longer use YAML...

pass all unit tests again jruby

speed up slow unit tests
make the overlay window uncloseable (?)
note that youtube can be downloaded then a local edited copy created, from that download. (mb add downloading ability?)
screencast of things helpful (use, creation...).
tune up the levels...
prototypes of the experimental stuff (overlay, track time while recording -> map file, specifiable levels, more?)

fix:
  0:01:01.9 next will be at 0:01:02.0s (r [or q to quit]):
  0:01:04.0 next will be at 0:01:06.5s (blanked) (r [or q to quit]): "warning--unable to track screen time for some reason" # *of course you can't track it now!*

DRY up :levels--it's in the ocr spec as well as the others...

itunes video on demand player

blockbuster "rent" on demand player

no money making for now...all volunteer...more respectful.
  or make it so it can work with an editor of some kind...like a "save here" command line snip this tuck that.
    probably only possible after creating the desktop streamer hmm

no releasing experimental for now, I guess

integrate with librivox' audio so you can avoid profanity in classics.  Somehow.  This would be nice for portable players.
  You know, for static things like this, a 'pre-cutter' would sure be convenient...
  provide download of edited mp3's for people.  ahhh.
  
itunes player for profanity (music)?

make a list of "known clean" movies...hmm...

an "online anybody can chat while watching this movie" (or anybody can edit this wav and listen to it as overlay...) prefer the latter.

an online applet web runnable? Why not?
  click here to watch your favorite film edited on hulu! Just click! [* yea!]
  
code refactors: "screen time change", order should be swapped in bin/x output (just cleanup)

easier installation for windows: self-extracting exe's :)
  later: .msi?

can blank overlay with added text like "and you are one awesome klingon"

ability to record it from online/live, then apply edits.

add my stuff to imdb...? make a wiki?

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", or "boring level x"

with VLC/youtube non full screen, it does the annoying mouse thing needlessly (which doesn't bug as much these days...)

can overlay with wav file (would work already for VLC [?], could also "click to mute" for others...hmm...)

the muting currently is so togglesy...if VLC ever fixes itself, fix this! 

fix any/all pending tests...

can permanently black out certain coords to keep things prettier...et al
  remove black when they really move the mouse?

Linux port (call that good enough for usability on TV's...), should be...
  OS X port

blanker outer with user specifiable color
  better default color?

Auto mute/blank commercials?

transfer ownership to a single LLC
  new github username
  new domains
  new sourceforge with that email
  new youtube

overlay/replace current playback with some url of audio or video
  user editable joke overlays (like a wiki...)
  realtime overlays (like group chat for those watching the film...)

control volume programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control mute programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control location programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.

compare VLC (and other) timings with a real DVD player, and with netflix instant, etc.

Have a "list of all known movies (url's)" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...
  or known parseable imdb's

does my sweet heart have any suggestions? (make it work well for laymen)

web browser plugin?
  popups *inside* netflix "play this edited" ?

Programmatically do all of the above, by driving VLC with libvlc (its API).
  So this would be basically tracking VLC using its libvlc callbacks, instead of screen times
  fork the Python project?
  VLC
    use VLC's web interface? telnet?
    optimize it with best appropriate iframes (LOL)

integrate with google TV...bravia...maybe...somehow...boxxee? roku?
  itunes TV? apple tv? ps3?

--server?  optionally higher prio?

@MRI:

irb(main):001:0> a = File.open('big1', 'w')
=> #<File:big1>
irb(main):002:0> a.seek 10_000_000_000
=> 0
irb(main):003:0> a.write 'b'
=> 1
irb(main):004:0> a.close # very slow mri 1.9.2
=======
take out all require 'rubygems'ses...

warn them when it looks like screen capture is very painful/expensive [is it too bad anyway, though] ? iff necessary

create a "book edit list" (word x is at position y...)

@dvd flick: 
  are your highest settings optimal?
  accept subtitled video...huh?
  accept multi-audio track videos
  
@smplayer: your CD config is awful.
@mencoder: can't split
something like you watch it *with* you friends and can all chat together...hmm...

do the same, but for books...also optimize them for reading through full volumes...you don't want a summary...don't want the title, know it's librivox...maybe say chapter x, that's it.  Probably start by just editing out the profanity, though :P Also do the Book of Mormon

@mencoder: ripping like this results in an (avidemux, VLC) fourcc of 'ugh':  mencoder2 dvdnav://1  -oac copy -ovc copy -o D:\raw_rip_mpeg_example.avi -endpos 20 -dvd-device E:\

@jruby: system("mencoder") from a button doesn't get interrupted by an exception [!]
@vlc: replay mp4's are too dark.

a DVD burner for ISO, then it can "burn over" some bad sectors? or you can grab an ISO and "null out" just where you wanted to?

maybe require them to rip their stuff "through some means or other" and we'll operate on the product based on an EDL list :) [could be more legal]


@rspec:   
1) EdlParser should raise for end before beginning
     Failure/Error: proc{ go({"mutes"=>{105=>104.9}})}.should raise_error(/SyntaxError/)
     expected Exception with message matching /SyntaxError/, got #<SyntaxError: warning--detected an end before a start 104.9 < 105.0>
     # edl_parser.spec.rb:115
     # :1
    
    message confusing :)

give money to nomachine--wow!

a boxee api? 
I *could* record netflix movies, then edit those manually (or mapped-ly)...meh clearplay needs some niche--we don't have each other after all.
donate to the top 25 sourceforge's that don't look illegal, esp. if haven't before
@mplayer: allow the equals in this: mplayer dvdnav:// -dvd-device=f:

opening youtube, if not already opened, choose chrome in plugin, get this:
RuntimeError: poor width or wrong window 94 1 71
     initialize at c:/dev/ruby/sensible-cinema/lib/screen_tracker.rb:54
  new_from_yaml at c:/dev/ruby/sensible-cinema/lib/screen_tracker.rb:27
          go_sc at bin\sensible-cinema-cli:94
         (root) at bin\sensible-cinema-cli:128
        [hard exit]

create a "map" of VLC DVD timings to "real" timings via tracking.  Hopefully never necessary...
        
if it looks paused I should basically pause my tracking [if it looks nothing, then keep going with my tracking]
it fails on "friday" tracks 0:48 as 1:48
probably at startup should not start at 0, either, wait for first screen trackage
figure out a way to get to the roku [ps3ms?], +- netflix edited to roku LOL
