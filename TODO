== medium ==

  make all players actually play again

== low but actually want to do eventually (me) low prio: just do these...==

  youtube non full screen: work with other browsers
  slightly more accurate timestamp...
  can parse IMDB (require they put in the URL by hand)
  try the new GOCR sources...
  PISH
    add stuffs to imdb hmmm
  more often yell at them "not working"

== random backlog ... based on user request..remember:  just local files for my own needs...==

"just choose VLCx55" LOL

itunes video on demand

blockbuster "rent" on demand, online

beep at them when not tracking [?]

note: just plow forward, to "grab" available ideas...except that for now, just what *I* 
  plan on needing for myself (filters for what I need/want).

re-advertise on ruby talk

a real website

advertise on ruby flow

no money making for now...all volunteer...more respectful.
  or make it so it can work with an editor of some kind...like a "save here" command line snip this tuck that.
    probably only possible after creating the desktop streamer hmm

integrate with librivox' audio so you can avoid profanity in classics.  Somehow.  This would be nice for portable players.

itunes player for profanity (music)?

an "online anybody can chat while watching this movie" (or anybody can edit this wav and listen to it as overlay...) prefer the latter.

an online applet web runnable? Why not?
  click here to watch your favorite film edited on hulu! Just click! [* yea!]
  a chrome plugin with imdb/community backing :)

code refactors: "screen time change", order should be swapped in bin/x output

auto-play on detect youtube url access...

easier installer for windows: release a zip file that they can just click on a .bat file to run it
  later: it installs/uninstalls appropo
    suggestion: self-extractor

make it able to use both windowed and maximized VLC (and full screen) seamlessly

can blank overlay with text like "and you are one awesome klingon"

screencast of things helpful (use, creation).

TSR that monitors "oh you're opening a VLC? you're playing the E drive? That's bob's big plan? You're maximized? Full screened? watching x on hulu? y on youtube?"

a netflix online player descriptor
  
add my stuff to imdb...? wiki ?

make youtube work if you have *several* open

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", or "boring level x"

with VLC/youtube non full screen, it does the annoying mouse thing needlessly (which doesn't bug as much these days...)

hulu non full screened descriptor

can overlay with wav file (would work already for VLC [?], could also "click to mute" for others...hmm...)

fix any/all pending tests...

can permanently black out certain coords to keep things prettier...

Linux port (call that good enough for usability on TV's...), should be...

blank out with specifiable color
  better default color?

Auto mute/blank commercials?

transfer ownership to an LLC
  new github username

replay certain film sections :P

overlay/replace current playback with some url of audio or video
  user editable overlays (like a wiki...)
  realtime overlays (like group chat for those watching the film...)

control volume programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control mute programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.
control location programmatically (using mouse) on the player itself.

compare VLC (and other) timings with a real DVD player...

overlay with an alpha transparent pic

Have a "list of all known movies (url's)" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...

does my sweet heart have any suggestions? (make it work well for laymen)

some type of installer that can setup the registry...

auto-assignment of EDL's to media:
  auto-play option for DVD's (auto-start?)
    use normal differentiation
    use spiffy differentiation for DVD's on windows
  DVD's (right click on DVD player, play with scene-skipper?)
  web browser plugin?

Programmatically do all of the above, by driving VLC with its real API.
  VLC
    Allow it to record somehow (recordable)
     burnable to DVD/CD ...
    use VLC's web interface? telnet?
    optimize it with best appropriate iframes (LOL)

star trek: generations first profanidade...

"Showing EDL Information During Playback"

integrate with google TV/bravia...maybe...somehow...boxxee?
  itunes TV, too?

OCR the captioning as an auto profanity filter? (or perhaps download subtitles to be able to pre-screen), like the python fella does..
  what else does python do that we can learn from? can we combine projects somehow, perhaps? 

make an index of watchable on imdb based on stars (?)
