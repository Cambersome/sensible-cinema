You can create an edit list for sensible cinema to use against whatever DVD you want 

An edit list (currently) lists sections you want muted or skipped.  Here is an example

"mutes" => [
  "02:02:15.0" , "02:02:25", "a muted demo section",
],

"blank_outs" => [
  "02:02:00.0" , "02:02:10", "blanked out demo section",
],

"name" => "Greatest Story Ever Told",

You can see more examples in the "edit decision list/dvds" folder: https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/tree/master/zamples
There are a few other things you can have in there too.

To create a new one, for a DVD, the steps typically look like this:

open Sensible cinema (with "advanced--edit create mode...bat")

insert your DVD, click "Create new edit list for DVD" button (advanced/create mode).

Then download a subtitle file for your movie, 
Basically download a subtitle file for your DVD from opensubtitles.org or the like (if you can figure out how to navigate their site)
then use the "advanced create" mode and have it parse the subtitle for profanities, using the "parse srt" button

Current problem with that button is that it's not super user friendly yet (hopes to be at some point), 
requiring you to copy and paste values very carefully,
and also when you synchronize the .srt file you can't actually do that easily with some DVD's that have a timestamp reset

https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/wiki/Detecting-mplayer-dvd-reset-times

You can probably use the mplayer-edl-friendly player to coordinate the timestamps.

That gets you going, then you watch it and add any other "questionable" scenes to your EDL.

For the rest of the buttons, just "mouse over"/"hover over" them for full descriptions of their potential uses.

After you're done, you can submit your new edit list to us at sensible cinema
(so others can use it later) by using the Upload button and sending an attachment, or send an attachment to rogerdpack@gmail.com

A few pointers:

  Some other helper programs like SubtitleEdit (windows) or jubler (multi-platform) might help with synchronizing the subtitles, 

 You can also generate your own (super accurate) subtitle .srt file by using 
 You can make several different "edit lists" per DVD, using different filenames.
    For example one might take out all profanity, and a second take out profanity and also remove all violence, or whatever.
    Basically different levels :)
 You can also just watch a DVD (using any DVD player), and get timestamps that way, before creating an edit list.
   You'll have to convert them using the "convert timestamp" button.
 A good computer program for this is "smplayer" (the [ and ] keys control playback speed, and right and left, 
   page up and page down buttons control seeking), and you can also turn on subtitles to help locate profanity.  
   See also the "tooltip" for the "convert timestamp" button.
 Also note that you can rewatch the whole thing when you're done, just to double check and see 
  if you got all time signatures right (using "create DVD file on local hard drive" button).
 Also note that you could also add your timing information to IMDB's parental guide wiki pages about movies.  
  This can help users of other than sensible cinema with editing their movies, or at least knowing the content.
  You can even add timestamps there.
 Also note that you don't need to "grab" the DVD to your hard drive at all to edit.  You can just 
   watch it in smplayer with 'on-screen-display' enabled (o key), then convert the timestamps to 29.97 with the "convert timestamp"
   button (or watch it in a hardware DVD player with the same effect).
   You could also get a similar effect by setting up your EDL with its mplayer_dvd_splits http://goo.gl/yMfqX ,
   then use math and smplayer's timestamps to get the right timestamps.  See also the tooltip to the "convert timestamp" button.
 You could ask on the mailing list if somebody else could do the EDL for you, or offer to pay somebody there, I guess.
 If you have watched a DVD with your hardware DVD player, then realize that the timestamps will probably be slightly off.
    The DVD player has timestamps in "30 fps" while we use the (slightly more accurate) 29.97 fps for the EDL's, so use the convert button there.
