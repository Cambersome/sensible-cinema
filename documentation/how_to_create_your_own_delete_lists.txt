You can create a delete list for sensible cinema to use against whatever DVD you want 

A delete list (currently) lists sections you want muted or skipped.  Here is an example

"mutes" => [
  "02:02:15.0" , "02:02:25", "a muted demo section",
],

"blank_outs" => [
  "02:02:00.0" , "02:02:10", "blanked out demo section",
],

"name" => "Greatest Story Ever Told",

You can see more examples in the "edit decision list/dvds" folder, here: https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/tree/master/zamples

To create a new one, for a DVD, the steps typically look like this:

open Sensible cinema (with "advanced--edit create mode...bat")

insert your DVD, click "Create new delete list for DVD" button

Now you want to add timestamps and then test them to make sure they're accurate, using the various buttons.
Just edit the file, save it, then choose the button you want, to test out your new deletion.

You can use the "Watch DVD unedited" button
to save time, as it allows you to watch while it "grabs" it to the hard drive simultaneously (note: you'll
probably need at least a dual core processor for this to work well).

Note that you can also add timestamps then click "Watch DVD on computer realtime" to avoid having 
to rip it to your hard drive ever.  This is slightly less accurate, though maybe faster.  See also "pointers" below.

After you're done, you can submit your newly created delete list back to the project 
(so others can use it) by using the Upload button and sending a message with it.
Note also that if you know how, you could fork the code from github, commit changes, and 
submit a pull request if you desire to contribute, as well (for example more delete lists, etc.)
Email is probably easier though :)

A few pointers:

 You can make several different "delete lists" per DVD, just use different filenames.
    For example one could take out all profanity, and another take out profanity and also remove violence, or whatever.
    Basically different levels of deletion :)
 You can also just watch a DVD (using any DVD player), and get timestamps that way, before creating a delete list.
 A good computer program for this is "smplayer" (the [ and ] keys control playback speed, and right and left, 
   page up and page down buttons control seeking), and you can also turn on subtitles to help locate profanity.  
   You can also do the same thing using VLC player, except note that VLC's timestamps are a bit inaccurate [1].
 Also note that you should probably rewatch the whole thing when you're done, to double check and see 
  if you got the time signatures right (using "create DVD file on local hard drive" button).
 Also note that you can add your timing information to IMDB's parental guide pages about movies.  
  This can help users of other than sensible cinema with editing their movies.
 Also note that you don't need to "grab" the DVD to your hard drive to edit.  You can just setup the 
  EDL to work right [ http://goo.gl/yMfqX ] then use math to setup the correct time signatures.
