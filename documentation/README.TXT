== Troubleshooting ==

If you run into some snag, try cleaning your DVD and starting over (delete all files, start again). 
Baking soda toothpaste might help with cleaning it.
If it still errs, report it, along with a screen snapshot and steps of
how to reproduce the problem, preferably.  See the feedback section.

It can fail also because a deletion is past end of DVD, or 
Also make sure you aren't out of disk space.

Try playback in "VLC Media Player"

You try to play back a sensible cinema-ized video file and it plays back without
 audio or video (example: windows media player)?

 This probably means you're using windows media player, and don't have "codecs" installed
   to handle this type of audio.  Not to fear, just download the "ffdshow tryouts" (google for it)
   and, when it gives you the option, be sure to check "mpeg2 video" and then
   it should "just work."  You could also optionally just play the file in VLC Media Player or smplayer
   (there's a button for that).  Installing "AC3Filter" may help if you can hear no audio.  
   Really VLC Media Player is your best bet though.

If the end result picture is too grainy/pixelated or if the overall process is too slow, let me know and I'll work on
making it better.  No really, I have some ideas, but want to see if there's need first for improvement in those areas.

Finally, report back! If there are problems that arise, I want to hear about them so we can help you through it.
