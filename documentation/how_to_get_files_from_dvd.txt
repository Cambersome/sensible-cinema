Warning: before grabbing any video files from your DVD's,
please consult the is_it_legal_to_copy_dvds.txt file to 
check for legal ramifications.  Don't do anything illegal in
your country.

Basically, sensible cinema affords you 2 options for watching an edited movie.

Either stick the DVD in then click the "realtime play" button.
Or you can "grab" a video file off a DVD through some "off-line means", 
then Sensible Cinema can take that file and slice and dice out the profanity etc, 
creating for you a new edited version of the video file

For the latter, you could download the Big Buck Bunny DVD ISO, and try 
it out on that [1].

Sensible Cinema only accepts raw "unencrypted" movie streams, 
so you're going to have to get the movie file off the DVD somehow first.
There are a few options available to you.
Some options are described here http://wiki.videolan.org/Rip_DVD#Related
(basically, use mplayer, or use both makemkv + tsmuxer).
Look for the "title track" setting in the EDL to see which you'll want, 
usually the longest title.

In the end, you want to have available an unencrypted "mpeg" or "mpeg-ts" file.

Slysoft AnyDVD might help out somehow, too, though you shouldn't need to.

Report back if you have problems.  See README for contact info.
