To use this (upscaling from your own computer):

Steps:

download/install uscreencapture: http://www.umediaserver.net/umediaserver/download.html

download+install "windows sdk" http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924 (rather big one here :) )

download virtualdub: http://www.virtualdub.org/download.html

Now start your "subject" to upconvert (ex: hulu, or netflix instant).  
You can pause it if desired.  Don't fullscreen it.
You'll want to leave it on its smallest "window" possible, that still has the most detail.
So basically don't let your "subject" player do any stretching, you want to leave all of that for 
this program to do.

Next you'll need dual monitor, ex: laptop screen plus the VGA out on the laptop.
Position your "subject" movie so that it is flush in the top right of either monitor.
See the file "position_window.png" for an demo. Installing NiftyWindows then 
"right mouse button+drag" can help you reposition it just right.

Now in virtualdub, open the file upconvert_from_screen.avs.

Click the "play" bottom left button.
See if it is capturing the right monitor, how much of the video it is capturing, if any.

Now search for the program "graphedt.exe", for me, this was in C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.1\Bin

Run it.  Use it to open the file uscreen.GRF
Right click on the box "uscreencapture"
Adjust the various properties so that it captures the video region you desire, by editing values, click "Apply",
then clicking the "save" icon within graphedit.  Then reopen the file within virtualdub to test your new settings.
Note the x and y values you use.

Now edit the text upconvert_from_screen.avs and fill in appropriate values.

Now run it in virtualdub again, move virtualdub to your output display, enjoy watching it.
