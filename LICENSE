May contain some 3rd party libraries under their own (separate, open source) licenses.

Note that this software should be legal in the EU, 
as it is only software and therefore theoretically not subject to patents (see "What about patent licenses?" in [2]).
It's basically for use in the EU.
If it's not legal in your country, don't use it!

honest about DMCA (we don't distribute the cracker, we don't redistribute, don't perform any acts, etc.)
if you burn you'll eventually be using a DMCA compatible player :P
long list of players...we're not alone :)
the authors of the program might not be liable for damages.  We don't feel dishonest about it, as long as 
we own the DVD and have it with us when we watch the edited version.


not more unethical than ripping your DVD collection to hard drive so you can keep your DVD's all in one 
place and don't have to worry about losing them.  Then you edit them manually to remove cruft, and watch them
from there.

note that you are watching it using only bits and pieces of the original, similar to said bill.  And the
authors of the program might not be cupable of copyright infringement themselves, since they distribute no infringed materials.

Not responsible for your actions. Don't redistribute. "You run the risk on your own"
"should the courts someday rule..."  If DVD next to me...
