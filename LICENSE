May contain some 3rd party libraries/executables under their own (separate, open source) licenses.

Is this legal?  

Unclear.  In general ripping personal DVD's is fine.
It is controversial to use open source software to play/rip DVD's.
There are a few conflicting views.  
Sensible-cinema doesn't actually do any decryption or decoding, nor has any knowledge of it,
but calls out to another separate program to rip.  It doesn't even have knowledge
as to whether it is ripping something encrypted or not.  We don't distribute sensible-cinema with
that program, either.
You can ask the authors of that program if it is legal.  Apparently
libdvdcss that it uses has never been challenged in court, and uses a slightly different algorithm
than those that have.
Note also that fair use at times does allow one to "record" things for personal use/backup.
Using sensible-cinema is probably not any more unethical than ripping your DVD collection to your hard
drive so you can keep your DVD's all in one place.  It's about the same as ripping a DVD, editing
it in Windows Movie Maker to take out the bad scenes, then watching it.
It's about the same as using VLC Media Player to view a DVD, which also uses libdvdcss.
Also note that if you watch an edited DVD, your are using a DVD player that conforms
with DMCA specifications, so that might have some influence.


In general, you are responsible for your actions and use of this program.
It is possible that the authors of sensible-cinema are not cupable of anything
regarding its use themselves, since they re-distribute no edited media, 
nor distribute cracking codes.  In general, check your country's rules first.

In terms of copyright, it could be legal under the The Family Home Movie Act of 2005, 
at least in the United States, when viewed using the "playlist" option (v 0.10'ish, then later removed).
In general, if I have the original DVD sitting next to my TV, I don't feel bad about watching
its edited copy at the same time, but please consult a laywer first if you have any concerns.

Do not redistribute copied commercial DVD's.  We have learned from clean flicks that
redistributing edited commercial DVD's is illegal in the US.  We hope that sensible-cinema
is more legal, since you can get the DVD's from wherever you want, and it doesn't change their
structure at all.  Please don't redistribute.

DO NOT MAKE ILLEGAL COPIES.

Note that this software might well be legal in the EU, 
as it is only software and therefore thus possibly not subject to patents (see "What about patent licenses?" in [2]).
If it's not legal in your country, don't use it!
