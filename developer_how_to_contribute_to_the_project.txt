A few notes for developers:

You can test the program out out by (on windows) installing daemon tools, then mounting the DVD of "big buck bunny" (open source, freely available movie)
Or you could alternatively burn a copy of big buck bunny to DVD, then use that to test it against (a slightly more cross platform approach).

There are some demo DVD ISO's for development in 
http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema/releases/dvd_isos (my own DVD, I release it under the CC license, as well as some
other CC released licensed DVD's).

You should be able to run the program and test it out against said DVD, put it through its paces to demo it, fix it, etc.

Or if you have a DVD that already has a edit list available for it, you could use that, obviously.

The main development roadmap is in the TODO. If you have any feedback/feature requests, et al, post an
issue or post to the Mailing List: http://groups.google.com/group/sensible-cinema

Sensible cinema is written in jruby, and currently packages itself up as a zip with jruby-complete.jar 
with its required dependencies (see the Rakefile) for windows.

To run it from source, you may need to install a few gem dependencies (listed in the Rakefile)

or install them automatically:

$ jruby -S gem install sensible-cinema # installs dev. dependencies
Note that, in order to run the unit tests, you'll want to checkout the source from the repository to get all the test images

The tests are in the spec directory, though some of them are out of date as development has focused in other areas.

Note: you transfer (c) of materials to sensible cinema when you submit patches.

To run it via command line:
$ jruby bin/sensible-cinema # DVD output "parser/cutter"
$ jruby bin/sensible-cinema --create-mode # DVD output "parser/cutter" create mode [advanced]
$ jruby bin/sensible-cinema-cli # the experimental OCR tracker for arbitrary online/local/internet players.
  See "Advanced Usage"
  
See also the included rake file for bundling/running all the specs.

Feedback/contribution welcome :)

== mac os x developers ==

You'll have to install a few dependencies.  It will tell you which at runtime, or check the README

== Advanced Usage ==

For the screen tracker (the experimental version, see file experimental_online_player_ocr_readme.txt),
you could optionally specify the scene descriptions list and player list on the command-line, so you don't want to have
to re-select them like this will tell you how to run it from the command line:

C:\sensible-cinema-git-clone>jruby bin\sensible-cinema-cli --help
