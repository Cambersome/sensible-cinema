Now it offers you a button to either play it on your computer, using VLC, or rip it to a file
(possibly write that to some other media, then play it say on your DVD player), or play it using screen tracking.

== From various previous releases ==
It now provides for screen tracking of DVD's, youtube, hulu, and anything else you want to play on VLC, and has
automatic detection of CD-Drives for ripping/playing back.  It can handle full screen or windows playback.
It can rip from user specified "title tracks" now.  It has a nice GUI.  The GUI can tell you which DVD is in which 
drive so you know more easily which one to choose.

When screen tracking, it employs a "mouse moving" (feedback to computer) in order to keep the screen timestamp visible.
It allows for both "instant playback" watching a DVD, as well as "ripping a stream to a single file on your computer" in order to view
it from there (which is arguably easier to view).  The single file can be put on a flash drive and played
via some console or other player, or can be copied to a disc and played in a DVD/blu-ray player.

When screen tracking, it uses input to the system (simulated keystrokes) to simulate a user "mute"
It overlays the playing screen (movie) with a separate window in order to simulate a "blank out" or 
"skip this scene" which can be used with or without the mutes, as well.
