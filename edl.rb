some thoughts in other?

v 0.0:
  command line, keys that go + 0.1 or something, no screen capture, no GUI, can mute appropo...one mute command, one unmute
  MRI for now...
  
  it can parse some kind of EDL file for skipping

  
backlog prioritized:

  can blank appropo (overlay black screen)
  
  can screen grab to look for second changes as they occur [single line?]...
    hard coded values for well known players...

  OCR

  jruby with a nice GUI...

  can screen grab any "arbitrary" coordinates in a user intuitive way.



After commercials resync automagically...

Auto mute commercials?

rruby.net rubyy.net

new github username

PIHS

overlay a black screen

an easy creator...

increase volume
"a method of controlling the input devices to control the player and coerce the movie from one time point to another" (drag)

"a method of controlling the input devices to control the player and change volume"

"a method of applying OCR to the existing film to extrapolate position in the media"

replay certain parts

overlay with youtube
overlay with youtube audio
overlay/replace with some url of audio or video
control volume programmatically on the player it self.

overlay alpha transparent pic

grey out the screen...

drag and release for editing position, where possible.

Use audio to auto synchronize across different players, or to re-synchronize...

Have a "list of all known movies" and be able to open (IE et al) to the correct part, and start playing them, and they work...

Be able to have arbitrary user-programmable "do this recorded movement at this time"

handle arbitrary seeks to the middle of a blank section :)

user customizable levels...
  maybe even "I don't like ones that are x, y, z", or "boring level x"

auto-assignment of EDL's
  web plugin?
  DVD's
    VLC

can save to an mp4 file somewhere, or something burnable to CD. Oh baby. CD's are cheap. DVD is ok, too.

Programmatically do all of the above, by driving using an internal API.

Also there is much more on the blogs.
