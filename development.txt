Source code (free, GPL) : http://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema (create an issue for feature requests/bugs)

You can test the program out out by (on windows) installing daemon tools, then mounting the DVD of "big buck bunny" (open source, freely available movie)
Or you could alternatively burn a copy of big buck bunny to DVD, then use that to test it against (a slightly more cross platform approach).

You should be able to run the program and test it out against said DVD, put it through its paces to demo it, etc.

Or if you have a DVD that already has a delete list available for it, you could use that, obviously.

The main development roadmap is in the README. If you have any feedback/feature requests, et al, post an
issue or post to the Mailing List: http://groups.google.com/group/sensible-cinema

It's written in jruby, and currently packages itself up as a zip with jruby-complete.jar with its required dependencies (see the Rakefile).

The tests are in the spec directory, though some of them are out of date as development has focused in other areas.

Currently it's windows only, ping me if you want that changed.

We welcome all feedback/contribution :)
