  === patentzy yes actually do vaguely ordered ===
    make it suck in large list of EDL's from imdb at build time
    blu-ray OCR
      more blu-ray stuff: can ID them, can playback (through...mkv? VLC? powerdvd OCr/scripted?)
      some blu-ray player descriptor somehow
    can move the mouse 10 pixels down at the beginning, in order to...put it in the right place.

    can handle multiple dvdid's et al (same EDL) (mostly do already though)
    can overlay over online films too
    it can pull in a DVD based just on the dvd-id "query id, not local? go get it from online"
    control VLC RC to overlay a logo dynamically
    can control volume *and* play other audio
    can add to to supplement EDL + EDL timestamps
    can pick specific profanities to avoid
    manual select which to include into an EDL
    user preference "how many down clicks on volume for profanity"? 
    make it so it can suck in from "another wiki" the DL's, at package time, somehow (just one)
      or even just suck in any web file, for starters
    space -> advance from pause until next edit item?
    amazon player descriptor, just in case ;P
    can jerk mouse only every so often (cheap would be to just arbitrarily have it from x to y, demo that)
    can scan several player descriptors to "pick the right one" (kind of already showed this one)
    edited streamer screencast demo (the rumor guy demo, like zediva)
    incorporate the EDL translator from the BYU-I fella
    post a demo of it playing back blu-ray edited local computer, +- projector, +- playon (?)
    post some playon.tv demo screencast...this should prove all shouldn't it [?]
    can "control mouse" to drag it to change location (ex: "move down 10 pixels at beginning of movie" LOL)
    beep at them/warn when not tracking [?]
      default on...I think.
    can jerk mouse more often closer to failure sections...
      and/or resize the playing/streaming window to match it when the mouse "has been moved recently" +- by us, or not.
    can pull one from imdb at all, video "show it creates a file"
    C DVD player: minimize instead of skip :P
    don't mute, just almost mute LOL or almost mute and static-ify
      or combine the two
    can suck it in "in realtime" from online, and parse it +- from a user editable wiki
    a UI to select categories, works
    edited blu ray movie playback screencast, as that's apparently not in the patent...
    don't use timecodes, use "% of the movie" and "total length" perhaps?
    look at their patents for other ideas? [+- nissim patents?]
    just pause it, tell them how far to fast forward at that point :P
    have the user forced to tell me what each digit is, themselves :P
    the online edl stuff itself (its todo list)
    javascript API
      phase 2: I can accomodate for pauses, too.
      phase 3: I can re-train based on events of stoppage
      phase 4: I can constantly poll and react
    post video demo of it streaming to a console device
    categories filterable by "level" "profanity level 2 and below is ok for me and my kids"
    maybe could just "play from x to y" [no exclude info?] 
    stage one: query, auto-download when they hit a netflix movie of some type
      stage two: chrome plugin for the same :)
    can insert deleted scenes et al [even external scenes :P] (already showed it)
