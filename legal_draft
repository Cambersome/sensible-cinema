The design, not the idea.

OCR can work on internet or standalone players.
time elapsed "since the timestamp changed" on screen infers the more precise millisecond 
you are at, for being able to skip, mute, overlay, apply overlaid transparent image/video more precisely.
You can grab the specific coordinates by precise location, or by iterating over windows, or by relative location to screen coordinates/window coordinates.
You can use the url to infer the title desired.
You can use user preferences to infer how to use each setting within the "EDL" by saving the user preference, and comparing it 
against each entry in the EDL when you parse it.

It can mute by clicking a mute button, by accessing an API.
It can work by monitoring, using an API, the current playback time.

It can react to "seek" commands to coordinate position within EDL's.

Another invention: it can apply editing "commands" to a player that is playing back blu-ray discs (hardware or software), as originally described in other clearplay
patents, like US6889383 and those issued to them afterward.

You can get the specific digits by "absolute digit location" or by "OCR on the entire timestamp"

Could also playback using avisynth.

Can create edited files.
