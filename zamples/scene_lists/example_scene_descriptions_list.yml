mutes:
  "00:00:01" : "00:00:02" # mute from second 1 to second 2
  # so an example would be
  "00:00:01" : "00:00:02" # profanity: dang
  "01:01:00" : "01:02:00" # mute from one hour one minute to one hour two minutes
  # items can be out of chronological order

blank_outs:
  # this first one blanks (by overlaying *over* the video a black window) 
  # from one hour one minute to one hour two minutes
  # an example would be
  "01:01:00" : "01:02:00" # sex scene
  
# you can also add other things after, here, like title, source, whatever you want
# these are basically free form and not actually used yet
