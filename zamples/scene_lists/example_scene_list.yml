mutes:
  2.0 : 3.0 
  4.0 : 5.0 # mute from second 4 to second 5
  9.0 : 13.0 # mute from second 9 to second 13
  44.0 : 50.0 # mute for 6 seconds starting at second 44
  # This next means mute from one minute to one minute one second
  1:00 : 1:01
  10:01 : 10:02 # mute from ten minutes, one second to ten minutes, 2 seconds
  # if you use decimals, you'll have to put them in quotes
  # 01:01:01.05 (for one hour, one minute, one second and a half) does not work
  # "01:01:01.05" does
  "01:01:00.5" : "01:01:01.5" # mute from one hour one minute and a half second to one hour one minute and 1.5s
  
blank_outs:
  "00:15" : "00:18" # blank from second 15 to 18
  01:01 : "01:02.0" # blank from one minute one second to one minute two seconds, etc.
  1:00:00 : 1:00:30 # note also that if you blank something out it isn't muted unless you *also* add it to the mute list, above. Message me if you want that changed.

what_aspects_were_not_able_to_be_removed, url, DVD label, etc, though in reality the only required ones are mutes and blank_outs"
