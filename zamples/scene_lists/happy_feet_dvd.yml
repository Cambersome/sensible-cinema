mutes:
  1:45 : 2:25   # sensuality: let's talk about eggs, baby...
  46:36 : 46:41 # sensuality: my couch of perpetual indulgence
  "01:33:25.0" : "01:33:50.0" # sensuality: a few sensual lyrics
blank_outs:
  "55:35" : "55:42.0" # sensuality: some "questionable" dancing

overall: "feels somewhat odd, makers definitely have an agenda,
which appears to be environmentalism, a bit of sensualism, and anti-religion/authority.
It has lots of varied, fun music.  Something of an agenda."
