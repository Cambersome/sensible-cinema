Basically to create a player description you tell it the window title and the coordinates of the "clock" as it plays.

  some tips:
  
    use WinCheat to see window names (under "Text")
    run scene-skipper with -v -- it will dump a screenshot of the window in question
    use Paint.net to examine the dumped graphic and get coords

you can specify "test" for the "mutes_list.yml" to have it just the player_description.yml and exit
it will screen capture your segment to your current working directory.

NB that the clock coords can have negative start offsets, which mean "distance from the bottom right corner"
