mutes:
  "00:00:01" : "00:00:02" # mute from second 1 to second 2
  # so an example would be:  
  "00:00:01" : "00:00:02" # profanity: dang
  "01:01:00" : "01:02:00" # mute from one hour one minute to one hour two minutes
  # note: items can be out of chronological order

blank_outs:
  # this first one blanks (by overlaying *over* the video, a black window)
  # from one hour one minute to one hour two minutes, like:
  "01:01:00" : "01:02:00" # "sex scene"
  # you can also use fractions, like 3 minutes 3 seconds and a half to 3 minutes 4 seconds and a half:
  "00:03:03.5" : "00:03:04.5"
  # if you don't want to be explicit, you can reference a *number*
  # from the category descriptions.yml file, like
  "01:01:00" : "01:02:00" # "bodily function strong # 1"
  # instead of
  "01:01:00" : "01:02:00" # s***
  
  # (if it's not there then just write it in your file and I'll add it later, or notify me)
  
# you can also add other notes, too, like title, source, whatever you want
# these are basically free form and not used for anything else yet
