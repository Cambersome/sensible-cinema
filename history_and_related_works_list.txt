== Overly Verbose History ==

Sensible Cinema was preceded/inspired by EDL's of editors in the 90's, cleanflicks (both analog and digital incantations, late 90's), 
then mplayer began to support EDL, zoomplayer added a scene-cut editor, 
http://code.google.com/p/movie-content-editor came along, and also many
other editors have historically supported EDL for content creation and/or playback (see wikipedia's "edit decision list"),
such as mythtv/XBMC's EDL support (as suggested by the phantom edit [1], oreillynet.com), 
VLC also added playlists with optional start and stop positions per entry.  Ffmpeg, mencoder were high quality video editing open source tools. 
Once I discovered all of these previously existing programs, I knew the right elements were ready for 
something like sensible cinema.

See also the "related" section, and "motivation" section.

Originally the project started as a prototype to "watch hulu (online) and netflix instant movies
edited" (it uses/used screen snapshots (of specific locations where the digits are expected, based on windows position) 
and then tracks, using OCR of the on-screen (convert to timestamp), to monitor it for specific times relative 
to an EDL, and react appropriately.
However, this functionality, though working and available, is disabled currently for potential patent
issues.  Some older released versions had it enabled, but not the later releases.
Then I realized I could basically have the same effect by instructing a video player (VLC) to "play from second x to y"
ok "now play from z to q muted" etc. (so kind of a stop and go video player, kind of like controlling the remote for you).
It basically was implementing Edit Decision Lists (EDL's) using playlists and
VLC.  
I just passed VLC a playlist, it did all the work for me, without any necessary real-time tracking.  This seemed patent friendly,
so I went with this.  There are a few released versions with this feature enabled.  
They avoid real-time tracking by specifying "play from here to here"
not "skip from here to here" as some other editing players do.

Then it occurred to me that one could grab the several clean segments
off a movie file, and piece them together to create an edited clean version ( a la cleanflix ).  This also avoids 
realtime tracking, so I also included this ability.
The playlist option is disabled in later releases, as it was deemed too user-non-friendly, and because VLC timing
is "different" than standard DVD players, so I decided to just use standardized timing, though it worked fine
for VLC playbacks.
I replaced it with support for mplayer's EDL format, which works better, and has consistent timing, though is still a bit buggy.

You can see a full list of other features that have been published and demonstrated
in the accompanying file change_log_with_feature_list.txt.  Each feature mentioned works 
in some released version of sensible-cinema though some features have been removed in subsequent versions
(they're all available as rubygems).

Who knows what the future will hold...
