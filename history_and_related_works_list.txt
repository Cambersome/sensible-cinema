== Overly Verbose History ==

Sensible Cinema was preceded by EDL's [2] of video editors in the 90's, 
cleanflicks (both analog and digital/DVD incantations, late 90's), 
then more recently mplayer began to support EDL, zoomplayer added a scene-cut editor some years ago
(and a place to share them http://forum.inmatrix.com/index.php?showtopic=129 since 2004), 
PowerDVD added a "movie remix" feature (for DVD's, blu-ray) with its version 8 (including
the ability to share remixes with others on the MoovieLive web site since 2008 [3]),
http://code.google.com/p/movie-content-editor came along, and also many
other editors have supported EDL for content creation and/or playback,
such as mythtv/XBMC's EDL support (as suggested by the phantom edit [1], from oreillynet.com), 
VLC also added playlists with optional start and stop positions per entry.  
Ffmpeg, mencoder were high quality video editing open source video tools. 
Once I discovered all of these previously existing programs, I knew the right pieces were ready.

See also the "related" section, and "motivation" section.  See also the change_log_with_feature_list.txt file, and several
blog entries I've posted to various blogs.

Originally the project started as a prototype to "watch hulu (online) and netflix instant movies
edited" (it uses screen snapshots (of specific locations where the digits are expected, based on window positions) 
and then tracks, using OCR of the on-screen (convert to timestamp), to monitor it for specific times relative 
to an EDL, and reacts appropriately.
Then I realized I could basically have the same effect by instructing any video player (VLC) to "play from second x to y"
ok "now play from z to q muted" etc. (so kind of a stop and go video player, kind of like controlling the remote for you).
It basically was implementing Edit Decision Lists (EDL's) using playlists and
VLC.  
I just passed VLC a playlist, it did all the work for me, without any necessary tracking on my part.  
This seemed to be a different approach than some other programs out there take, so I 
explored this route.  There were even a few released versions with this feature.  
They avoid real-time tracking by specifying "play from here to here"
not "skip from here to here" as some other players do.

Then it occurred to me that one could grab the several clean segments
off a movie file, and piece them together to create an edited clean version ( a la cleanflix ).  This also avoids 
realtime tracking, so I also included this ability.
The playlist option is disabled in later releases, as it was deemed too user-non-friendly, and because VLC timing
is "different" than standard DVD players, so I decided to just use standardized timing, though it worked fine
for VLC playbacks.
I replaced it with support for mplayer's EDL format, which works better, and has consistent timing, 
though is still a bit buggy, please report any issues you may find on it.

You can see a full list of other features that have been published and demonstrated
in the accompanying file change_log_with_feature_list.txt.  Each feature mentioned works 
in some released version of sensible-cinema though some features have been removed in subsequent versions
(they're all available as rubygems).

Who knows what the future will hold...

PowerDVD from version 8 on has a "remix" functionality http://www.cyberlink.com/stat/product-tutorial/enu/powerdvd/8/movieremixes.jsp including some innovative features, such 
  as being able to continue playing with a "blank screen" and adding effects, adding audio (ex: voice overs), "blurring" scenes and sections of movies, 
  and uploading and downloading (sharing) remixes with others through a central point of distribution. 
  some people have made downloadable collections for it, as well, see: http://pcnoevil.org/ and https://www.facebook.com/ClearplayFilterForum (there was in 2009 PCNoEvil.com which shared remixes too)
  (there is also a canonical ability to share remixes with others on the MoovieLive web site since 2008 [3])
