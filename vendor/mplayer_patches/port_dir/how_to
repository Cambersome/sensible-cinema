to
/opt/rdp_project_local/etc/macports/sources.conf
# ref: http://guide.macports.org/#development.local-repositories

$ portindex # within there somewhere

you now want osd variant
this basically collides with mplayer, I guess [without any way around that?] so you cannot install this and any other mplayer port

$ export PATH=/opt/rdp_project_local/bin:$PATH
$ sudo port -kd install mplayer-edl +osd
$ port mdmg rdp-projects # and distribute

# to build home macports: ./configure --prefix=/opt/rdp_project_local --with-applications-dir=/Applications/rdp_projects
