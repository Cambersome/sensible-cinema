you want osd variant
this basically collids with mplayer, I guess [without any way around that?] so you cannot install this and any other mplayer port


sudo port -kd install mplayer-edl +osd

home macports: ./configure --prefix=/opt/rdp_project_local --with-applications-dir=/Applications/rdp_projects

add
/Users/rogerdpack/sensible-cinema/vendor/mplayer_patches/port_dir
to
/opt/rdp_project_local/etc/macports/sources.conf
