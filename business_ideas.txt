Not that I plan on making money on it, but...

 a business model where DVD's could be
purchased (along with the original) with any filter they'd like
applied.  The author of the filter would receive a percentage of the
sale, prompting more people to upload quality edits so theirs gets to
be #1.

Or pay x to use filter once, or charge a "donation fee" when downloading
SC at all, or a cut of the filter per download, or a "donation"
per filter (with a cut) per download.

Or make it all free and rely on charitable community crowd-sourcing only :P
