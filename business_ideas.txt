Not that I plan on making money on it, but...

 a business model where DVD's could be
purchased (along with the original) with any filter they'd like
applied.  The author of the filter would receive a percentage of the
sale, prompting more people to upload quality edits so theirs gets to
be #1.

Or pay x to use filter once, or charge a "donation fee" when downloading
SC at all, or a cut of the filter per download, or a "donation"
per filter (with a cut) per download.

people can send you a file and you send it back edited to them LOL (file meani
ng a rip of some DVD they own, +- requiring them to send in an original DVD too
LOL.


Or make it all free and rely on charitable community crowd-sourcing only :P

google TV app for $4.99
They send you the original DVD and the ripped version, you send them back an edited ripped version and their original DVD.
