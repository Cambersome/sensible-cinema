FAQ

Q. How can I easily watch this on my TV, not on my computer, silly!

A. Currently you'll either need to attach your computer to your TV (buy some long cables, or a new graphics card, etc.
   or get a laptop you can use as an HTPC (ex: buy a used older one).

  There is also some work working toward getting the stuff playing on your computer to stream live to your wii/ps3/xbox:
    E-mail me if you're interested in trying it out.
