A few notes for developers:

You can test the DVD portion of the program out by mounting the DVD of "big buck bunny" 
http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema/releases/dvd_isos has it and a few other creative commons ISO's for use.
On windows daemon tools helps there, or "magic ISO" or the like, may be helpful to avoid having to burn disks.

Or you could alternatively burn a copy of big buck bunny to DVD, then use that to test it against 
(a slightly more cross platform approach I guess).

Then rip it and use the output, or use it as your DVD.

Or if you have a DVD that already has a edit list available for it, you could use that, or create
a new edit list for a DVD you own, etc.

If you have any feedback/feature requests, et al, post an
issue or post to the Mailing List: http://groups.google.com/group/sensible-cinema

To run it from source, download from github, you may need to install a few gem dependencies (listed in the Rakefile)

or to install them automatically:
$ jruby -S gem install rake os sane jeweler # some helper gems
$ jruby -S rake build
$ jruby -S gem install pkg\*.gem --development
# optional:
$ jruby -S gem uninstall -x sensible-cinema # uninstall the gem so you don't have to worry about it conflicting later, just in case.
 
You'll have to install some git submodules, too.
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

The tests are in the spec directory, though some of them are out of date as development has shifted focus to other areas.

Note: you transfer (c) of materials to sensible cinema when you submit patches/contributions, of course, so don't submit something you don't want published :)

Also you'll need to run git submodule init && git submodule update (possibly modify .gitsubmodules to be the open one, or ask me to)

To run it via command line:

$ jruby bin/sensible-cinema --help # tells you all available options
$ jruby lib/edl_parser edl_filename.txt # outputs the file, but parsed, and in YAML, useful for porting to other programming languages.
Feedback/contribution welcome :)

Ex: want JSON'ified output somehow? Just ask.

You'll have to install a few dependencies.  It will tell you which at runtime, 
or see the installation instructions: http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema
