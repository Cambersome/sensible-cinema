A few notes for developers:

If you have any feedback/feature requests, et al, post a github
issue or post to the Mailing List: http://groups.google.com/group/sensible-cinema

To run it from source, download from github, you may need to install a few gem dependencies (listed in the Rakefile)

to install them automatically [has to be remote like this until https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/issues/96 is fixed I think]:
$ jruby -S gem install --development sensible-cinema
# ... it installs it and tons of dependencies
# next optional:
$ jruby -S gem uninstall -x sensible-cinema # uninstall the [old] gem so you don't have to worry about it conflicting later, just in case.
 
You'll have to install some git submodules, too.
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

The tests are in the spec directory, though some of them are out of date as development has shifted focus to other areas.

Note: you transfer (c) of materials to sensible cinema when you submit patches/contributions, of course, so don't submit something you don't want published :)

To run it via command line (see go*.sh files):

Want JSON'ified output somehow? Just ask.

You can test the DVD portions of the program out by mounting the DVD of "big buck bunny" 
http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema/releases/dvd_isos has it and a few other creative commons ISO's for use.
On windows daemon tools helps there, or "magic ISO" or the like, may be helpful to avoid having to burn disks.

Or you could alternatively burn a copy of big buck bunny to DVD, then use that to test it against 
(a slightly more cross platform approach I guess).

Then rip it and use the output, or use it as your DVD.

Or if you have a DVD that already has a edit list available for it, you could use that, or create
a new edit list for a DVD you own, etc.

You'll have to install a few dependencies.  It will tell you which at runtime, 
or see the installation instructions: http://rogerdpack.t28.net/sensible-cinema

For the screen tracker (the experimental version, see file experimental_online_player_ocr_readme.txt).
