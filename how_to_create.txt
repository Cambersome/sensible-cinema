You create a delete list for sensible cinema to use against whatever you want.

An delete list looks something like this example:

https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/zamples/edit_decision_lists/example_edit_decision_list.txt

Basically your job is to create an appropriate file (like that one), 
then start sensible-cinema and instruct it to use your new file.

For a DVD, the steps might look like this:

open Sensible cinema "create mode"
insert DVD, click "create new" button

click "open ripped version of DVD unedited", right click, create new file, name it something.txt, right click, "open", and then select it.

it will rip that fella to the hard drive (for the save to filename, use the default).  
It will take quite awhile, but will get everything set up for quick editing after that point.

In the meantime, make your file look like this:

https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/zamples/edit_decision_lists/example_edit_decision_list.txt

After it finishes ripping it, it will start you watching it in mplayer, from which you can "derive" the parts you wish to delete.

Add timestamps to your file as necessary, then (exit smplayer and) click "Preview edited section of current DVD" (use the default filename),
give it a range "around" the edit you just added, then it will preview that segment.  If it didn't work, edit the file,
close smplayer, and hit "re-run most recent preview"

Also after you're done, you can delete any left over files that are still there.

Also after you're done, you can submit it back to the project by submitting it, see end of README.

A few pointers:
 You can make several different "delete lists" per DVD, just use different filenames.
    For example one could take out all profanity, and the other take out profanity and also remove tense scenes.
 You can just watch the DVD (using any DVD player), and get timestamps that way, before creating a delete list.
 A good computer program for this is "smplayer" (the [ and ] keys control playback speed, and right and left, page up and page down 
   buttons control seeking), and you can turn on subtitles to help locate profanity.  You can also use VLC, though
   recognize that VLC's timestamps are a bit off.
 Also note that you should probably rewatch the whole thing when you're done, to double check and see if you got the time signatures right
  (using grab mode).
 Also note that you can add timing information to IMDB's wiki pages about movies.  This can help users of other than sensible cinema
  with editing their movies.
 Also note that you don't need to "grab" the DVD to your hard drive to edit.  You can just setup the EDL to work right [ http://goo.gl/yMfqX ]
  then use math to setup the correct time signatures.
