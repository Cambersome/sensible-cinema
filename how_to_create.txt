You create a delete list for sensible cinema to use against whatever you want.

An delete list looks something like this example:

https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/zamples/edit_decision_lists/example_edit_decision_list.txt

Basically your job is to create an appropriate file (like that one), 
then start sensible-cinema and instruct it to use your new file.

For a DVD, the steps might look like this:

open Sensible cinema "create mode"
insert DVD, click "create new" button

click "open ripped version of DVD unedited", right click, create new file, name it something.txt, right click, "open", and then select it.

it will rip that fella to the hard drive (for the save to filename, use the default).  
It will take quite awhile, but will get everything set up for quick editing after that point.

In the meantime, make your file look like this:

https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/blob/master/zamples/edit_decision_lists/example_edit_decision_list.txt

After it finishes ripping it, it will start you watching it in mplayer, from which you can "derive" the parts you wish to delete.

Add timestamps to your file as necessary, then (exit smplayer and) click "Preview edited section of current DVD" (use the default filename),
give it a range "around" the edit you just added, then it will preview that segment.  If it didn't work, edit the file,
close smplayer, and hit "re-run most recent preview"

Also after you're done, you can delete any left over files that are still there.

Also after you're done, you can submit it back to the project by submitting it, see end of README.

A few pointers:
 I typically like to make two delete lists per DVD.  One that takes out swearing, sex, and gruesome violence, and another
   "more paranoid" version that takes out basically anything that could be offensive to anybody :) ("dang", "fetch", "too tense" of scenes...)
 You can just watch the DVD (using any DVD player), and get timestamps that way, before starting this.
 A good one is "smplayer" (the [ and ] keys control playback speed, right and left, page up and page down control seeking), 
 and you can turn on subtitles to help locae profanity (as also in VLC).
 You can watch the DVD using VLC Player, which has a "fast forward" button, just recognize that VLC's timestamps are always slightly off,
  so they'll only be approximate, but it might be close.
