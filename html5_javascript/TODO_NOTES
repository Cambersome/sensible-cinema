netflix remote app... [?]
netflix windows app? ... [?]

hack firefox so that one can enumerate over all objects in the whole land somehow???

window.netflix.cadmium.UiEvents.fireEvent ?? :|

smart phone/tablets/android etc: I think chrome is the only thing with widevine [that NFI needs?]
   so...I mean there was a link somewhere once about it but...
   either hope for plugins or...hack their binary [yikes?]
    or ask for them to support it natively [already did'ish...]
    or playon.tv/cast'ing it [?]
  probaly just provide a custom "rent a box" application for it (VPS) and RDP into it...
