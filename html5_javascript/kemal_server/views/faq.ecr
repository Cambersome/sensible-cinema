<h1>Frequently Asked Questions FAQ</h1>
<h3>Q:</h3>So is this legal?
<h3>A:</h3> 
We believe so.  Of course you're entitled to your own opinion.  We are not lawyers, either.  Congress codified in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Entertainment_and_Copyright_Act>Family Movie Act of 2005</a> that programs to "make indiscernible" portions of movies' audio or video, when done in the privacy of your own home, using authorized copies, are not a violation of copyright, whatever that's worth.  We have made some effort to also respect the terms of use of companies, and only support the use of legally streamed movies, so the movie companies and streaming companies get their dues as well (we refuse to edit out ads, for instance).  That being said, we are not laywers, so take our advice with a grain of salt, and only do what you think is morally ethical/fair and legal.  Consult your own layer if you have questions.  We encourage you to examine Terms of Uses yourself and only use this program if you feel it respects them, for instance.
<br/>Several movie production companies have mentioned they seem to not be averse to "secondary editing" (i.e. like what Play It My Way provides, where a second copy is not created), before.  And there is some help from the "Family Movie act of 2005" supporting the legality of secondary editing, at least it doesn't violate copyright, whatever that's worth.

<h3>Q:</h3>Do you have a contract with Amazon?
<h3>A:</h3>No, no we do not.  We did write a <a href=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ybcu-UlzU8Awz3no5uMVq9DrdBEyzAYnlZmHoWu7Poo/edit?usp=sharing>letter</a> to them (to their "contact us partnership" portal) saying "hey, we're going to do this, let us know if you want us to stop" and haven't since heard back.  Though certainly we're small fish at this point.  If at some point they do get back to us, and respond in the negative, we will try to find another provider that doesn't mind and take all our business and customers there :)For us it seems like a slam dunk in terms of helping Amazon, plus their Terms of Use don't seem to deny it as an option, and that's where it stands today.  We also don't have a contract with the movies studios or with google for its chrome web browser, though it does use an extension of the latter to provide the editing playback today.  We believe you are just "controlling" a legally streaming playback.  Hopefully everyone is OK with that.

<h3>Q:</h3>So is this moral? Ethical?
<h3>A:</h3> 
We flatter ourselves by believing so.  Let us tell you our take on it.  Imagine you're going to a play in a theater, but, feeling a bit under the weather that day, and you know an upcoming scene might make you a bit sick.  Is it OK to walk out for that scene then come back? Or is it OK to "look at the floor" in the theater and not watch when something happens in a movie that you're not comfortable with?  Is it OK to walk out during the closing credits of a movie and effectively "skip" those last few scrolling credits?  We think so.  But again, ony do what feels right to you here :)  For some parents, it's OK to watch unedited movies themselves, but then if they want to watch them with their kids, to dial down the intensity a little.  This also works well for that.  Power to the people! :)
<br/>Another take on it: for instance if it's a PG movie but you just want to be able to watch and "avoid any surprises" (for instance, the one single profanity in it) you might consider that an ethical option.  Or to create a "toned down" version of scary scenes of a Disney film, so that little kids don't have nightmares but can still "watch with the family" you might consider that an ethical option.

<h3>Q:</h3>Does this send the wrong message to Hollywood?
<br/>There's definitely the debate as to whether you should watch some "dirty" films, edited, at all.  That's your call of course.  Some films, even edited, still have a "dark feeling" about them, so use your best judgement even with edited versions.  We also provide an "whole entertainment" rating for our movies, which may be useful to you in your quest for wholesome entertainment.   We'll leave that one as a personal decision, if you feel we shouldn't then don't let us force you, but for those that "want" to watch those movies cleaned up, we do offer that option.  As to whether it sends the wrong message to Hollywood, my private hope is that we can show them "yes lots of people are watching these edited, you should tap into this market!" that kind of message.  Maybe we'll be able to show them :)

<h3>Q:</h3>How do I uninstall it? This thing is annoying!
<br/>
<h3>A:</h3>Right click on the little icon in the upper right, choose "remove from Chrome." We're sorry to see you go, please leave us some feedback so we can improve for future users!<br/>

<br/>
<h3>Q:</h3>Can Play It My Way skip advertisements for me?
<br/>
<h3>A:</h3>Well...we decided not to include that functionality, as it would not give the legal providers of your movie their dues (somebody has to pay for these movies).  So, sorry to disappoint there, but no plans currently.

<br/>
<h3>Q:</h3>Can it edit Netflix?
<br/>
<h3>A:</h3>Well...we decided not to include that functionality because it seemed like it violated parts of their Terms of Use ("no injection of code" it says).  Feel free to contact their support and tell them you wish you could use plugins that "don't violate copyright" to help with your playback :) We hope to eventually support Netflix, even if it requires massive work arounds.  For now we will recommend to our users that they purchase their streamed media from other sources :)
<br/>

<br/>
<h3>Q:</h3>Is this open source?
<br/>
<h3>A:</h3>Yes.  There is also <a href=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clean-editing-movie-player>our google group</a> to discuss the program, or for any questions, (ask if you want more, like netflix/hulu support, for instance, etc).
<br/>
Are you a developer? Here is the <a herf=https://github.com/rdp/sensible-cinema/tree/master/html5_javascript >source of the project</a> on github, fork it and help us program it!
<br/>

<br/>
<h3>Q:</h3>Is this going to get shutdown like VidAngel?  How does it differ?
<br/>
<h3>A:</h3>We believe we differ in a few key ways from vidangel.  We don't rip (or even stream) any movies, for instance.  We're not totally familiar with their legal battles but they seem to center around the fact that VidAngel was streaming the content without a legal streaming license.  We "support" edited movies from companies with legal streaming licenses (though don't have contracts with them pe se).
