<h1>Streaming Edited Movie playback for you or your family.</h1>
<br/>Take back control over what your view in your house! 
<br/>Ever wished you could mute profanities or skip objectionable scenes that distract during movies? We hope to finally give you control of what you watch. We believe you should have the ability to watch shows "your way" if in the privacy of your home, and we're here to help.
<br/>
We don't actually stream the movies, but provide you the ability to edit back your movie when you stream it from amazon or youtube, so you can choose which parts to actually watch.
<br/>
<br/>
Play It My Way is currently free while in Beta! For movies, we eventually plan to make it a "$1/filter or subscribe for $5/month", but during Beta, it's all free.  We'd love your feedback and support, and enjoy some awesome movies, edited, below!!<br/>

<div id=how_it_works >
<h3>How it works:</h3>
Basically, watch your movie on your computer from some webpage (ex: Amazon), our plugin will edit out the parts you don't want, see <a href=/getting_started>Getting Started</a> to install it!
<br/>
Plus if you notice something that should be tagged, you can tag it in our system and everybody, including yourself, will benefit!
</a>
</div>

<div id="success_chrome_extension_id" style="display: none;">
  <br/>
  <font face="verdana" color="green">
    Chrome plugin is <a href=/getting_started>installed</a>, nice work!  You can watch the below movies now. Your playback is going to differ from the original content (we're required by law to say that :) )
  </font>
</div>

<h3>Is it legal?</h3>
We believe so.  Because you are just editing playback of legally streamed content, we believe it's legit.  See the <a href="/faq">FAQ</a> for further explanation.
