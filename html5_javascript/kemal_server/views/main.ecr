<h1>Streaming Edited Movie playback for you and your family.</h1>
<br/>Take back control over what is viewed in your house! We believe you should have the ability to  watch shows "your way" if in the privacy of your home, and we're here to help.
<br/>Ever wished you could mute profanities or skip objectionable scenes that distract during movies? We hope to finally give you control of what you watch.
Offering personalized playback of amazon/amazon prime/youtube videos, and more!  
<br/>
Play It My Way is currently free while in Beta! For movies, we eventually might make it into a "subscribe for $2/month for all the edits you want" (first month free, if you can't afford it, you can get as many months as you want free), but during Beta, it's free for everyone.  We'd love your feedback and support, and enjoy some awesome movies!!<br/>

<h3>How it works:</h3>
<div id=how_it_works >
Basically, watch your movie on your computer from some webpage (ex: Amazon), our plugin will edit out the parts you don't want, see <a href=/getting_started>Getting Started</a> to install it!
<br/>
Plus if you notice something that should be tagged, you can tag it in our system and everybody, including yourself, will benefit!
</a>
</div>

<div id="success_chrome_extension_id" style="display: none;">
  <font face="verdana" color="green">
    Chrome plugin is <a href=/getting_started>installed</a>, nice work!  You can watch the below movies now. Your playback is going to differ from the original content (we're required by law to say that :) )
  </font>
</div>

<h3>Is it legal?</h3>
We believe so.  Because you are just editing playback of legally streamed content, we believe it's legit.  See the <a href="/faq">FAQ</a> for further explanation.

These are movies/shows/youtubes that we currently have in our system.  Don't see one you want? <a hrefinstructions_create_new_url>Add it</a> and help us out by tagging it and adding it to the system! (Note that eventually this will become a pay offering, but we'd love your help! Youtube will always be free!)
<br> You can also <a href=https://rdp.uservoice.com/forums/244075-general >vote</a> for a movie to be the next one on our queue to be edited.
<br>
&#10133; Anybody can add new films and new edits to our system!  We'd love your help!
<br/>Add another (not yet present) video to our edited system by <a href=/instructions_create_new_url>clicking here!</a>
