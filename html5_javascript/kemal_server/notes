== todo website Nik ==

Nik: not bright colors prolly

get started page

featured movie that clicks through to the movie page

movies page

just "get started" link that sends them to the get started page

send them to installation page if no app installed

"like" thing on the front page just one for dominant presence... (page).

navigation at the top "getting started" "movies" "faq"

let them click through movie but it only sends them to the install package LOL

website that I like?

she'lll do logo

word "easy" really big somewhere.

initial driving force "look at all these videos"
  "or you can edit your own, isn't that cool?"

"be a part of this join our team, sign up here, install the app!"

"in order to do this you need to register and install our app"

== business ==

"dp" is newer for amazon vs. gp hmm...

one free per month, otherwise choose your donation-level?
     offer money if they find/want to do new one LOL. $2 $5 ? yeah simpler on my head LOL
        $1 to check one/refine/tweak?
  definitely liking the free month
    so basically paywall this thing <waaah>
  TODO business survey :|

or "skew you, I'm going to pay through the nose for this thing"
  "if you want to donate to support, please do so by clicking here"
  I actually like this way too :)

== kemal notes ==
database with kemal:

https://github.com/sdogruyol/kemal-pg-sample/blob/master/src/app.cr (raw postgres...)

https://gist.github.com/rdp/f099508e26934d20938c4ffe37ee3298
connection pool, mysql...

it's actually using the pool right which is good...

other pool: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-db/blob/master/src/db/pool.cr

crystal-db only works with sqlite, mysql

I can use pools later, just open and close them for now [?] 
  what the...
   
 
I think "DB" is the main central DB fella...
  this is terrifying...I mean it feels like you'll have threading issues immediately and *everywhere* LOL


auth: filter
before_all do |env|
 raise "Unauthorized" unless authorized?(env)
end



before_all "/" do |env|
  puts "Setting response content type"
  env.response.content_type = "application/json"
end

db = ConnectionPool.new(capacity: 25, timeout: 0.01) do # its either this or open it raw yourself each method :|
  DB.open(ENV["DATABASE_URL"]) # only strings :|
end

before_get "/" do |env|
  env.set "is_kemal_cool", true
end

it needs some kind of session object store so you can store more than just strings in the env :|



== web server framework==

kemal or amethyst 

amethyst 2015?? assume dead :|

kemal is the only maintained one? LOL

kemal replaces moonshine

frost (too old/toast/unmaintained'ish ? )

toro == kemal but created 2016
  one of them [?]
  sooo confusing :|

== db ==

https://github.com/waterlink/active_record.cr

https://github.com/juanedi/micrate db migration :|

== netflix javascript ==

they call "setState" or some odd :| on something...hrm...

widevine?

error code m7375

fail windows 10 FF, IE, Chrome [html5]

ubuntu: normal FF silverlight

video_element has height

 playback klayer-ns playback-wrapper is above it...

 scrubber head klayer-ns surface  
 is the little dragger :|
 or scrubber target

so maybe coudl fake a seek there...I mean maybe LOL.

netflix remotes around???

https://www.stephanboyer.com/post/105/netflix-party-synchronize-netflix-video-playback


netflix remote app... [?]
netflix windows app? ... [?]

hack firefox so that one can enumerate over all objects in the whole land somehow???

window.netflix.cadmium.UiEvents.fireEvent ?? :|

smart phone/tablets/android etc: I think chrome is the only thing with widevine [that NFI needs?]
   so...I mean there was a link somewhere once about it but...
   either hope for plugins or...hack their binary [yikes?]
    or ask for them to support it natively [already did'ish...]
    or playon.tv/cast'ing it [?]
  probaly just provide a custom "rent a box" application for it (VPS) and RDP into it...
