  maybe if "cookie x not set"?

list for "watch later" for them :)

add an "edited" tag underneath images in the amazon "watchlist" "my video library" page

attempt a real iOS app

only show the age dropdown if "required" for that tag type? or flash it red if the right type...

don't use access tokens as GET params, barely wonky...

edge plugin (for underpowered HTPC boxes )
  should be legal! 

IP:

crystal:
  double check, sockets should have some ping/timeout thing so I don't get stuck with old connections...at least that...
  slam it with wrk, everything barfs all over the place :(
  stack traces come out so often, ugly
  various crystal bugs I could "help out with" (gzip, escape_javascript, server conns shuck...)
  figure out why query {"SELECT * from urls order by SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(url, '&#x2F;', 3), ':&#x2F;&#x2F;', -1), '&#x2F;', 1), '?', 1), amazon_prime_free_type asc, create_timestamp desc, name, episode_number"} took 00:00:00.0634933

allow multiple genres per movie
series -> their own page [so you can just review that instead...]
"auto get" amazon second url, prime type for series' 

private list of edits are shareable...or does that only make sense in the other model?
resurrect "fake" netflix playback :|
can upload file for image

an option "never show me r, or horror" in index

ask those one people to link to me (enjoymoviesyourway)

they can "at least playback" movies from google play index
