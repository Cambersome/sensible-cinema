== kemal notes ==
database with kemal:

https://github.com/sdogruyol/kemal-pg-sample/blob/master/src/app.cr (raw postgres...)

https://gist.github.com/rdp/f099508e26934d20938c4ffe37ee3298
connection pool, mysql...

it's actually using the pool right which is good...

other pool: https://github.com/crystal-lang/crystal-db/blob/master/src/db/pool.cr

crystal-db only works with sqlite, mysql

I can use pools later, just open and close them for now [?] 
  what the...
   
 
I think "DB" is the main central DB fella...
  this is terrifying...I mean it feels like you'll have threading issues immediately and *everywhere* LOL


auth: filter
before_all do |env|
 raise "Unauthorized" unless authorized?(env)
end



before_all "/" do |env|
  puts "Setting response content type"
  env.response.content_type = "application/json"
end

db = ConnectionPool.new(capacity: 25, timeout: 0.01) do # its either this or open it raw yourself each method :|
  DB.open(ENV["DATABASE_URL"]) # only strings :|
end

before_get "/" do |env|
  env.set "is_kemal_cool", true
end

it needs some kind of session object store so you can store more than just strings in the env :|



== web server framework==

kemal or amethyst 

amethyst 2015?? assume dead :|

kemal is the only maintained one? LOL

kemal replaces moonshine

frost (too old/toast/unmaintained'ish ? )

toro == kemal but created 2016
  one of them [?]
  sooo confusing :|

== db ==

https://github.com/waterlink/active_record.cr

https://github.com/juanedi/micrate db migration :|

== netflix javascript ==

they call "setState" or some odd :| on something...hrm...

widevine?

error code m7375

fail windows 10 FF, IE, Chrome [html5]

ubuntu: normal FF silverlight

video_element has height

 playback klayer-ns playback-wrapper is above it...

 scrubber head klayer-ns surface  
 is the little dragger :|
 or scrubber target

so maybe coudl fake a seek there...I mean maybe LOL.

netflix remotes around???

https://www.stephanboyer.com/post/105/netflix-party-synchronize-netflix-video-playback


netflix remote app... [?]
netflix windows app? ... [?]

hack firefox so that one can enumerate over all objects in the whole land somehow???

window.netflix.cadmium.UiEvents.fireEvent ?? :|

smart phone/tablets/android etc: I think chrome is the only thing with widevine [that NFI needs?]
   so...I mean there was a link somewhere once about it but...
   either hope for plugins or...hack their binary [yikes?]
    or ask for them to support it natively [already did'ish...]
    or playon.tv/cast'ing it [?]
  probaly just provide a custom "rent a box" application for it (VPS) and RDP into it...
