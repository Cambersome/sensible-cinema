  more "family" somehow...text, also image

== post kickstarter started ==
Try and go everywhere with ads/pub...

add multiple tags "new releases" "enjoyable by whole family"
add an "edited" moniker underneath each image?
make R rated a check box opt in?

break questions out to their own thing, we want to be pro-family don't we?? :)

seasons have their own page, really [so one link]
  or at least their own div or something LOL

double check everything has "amazon second urls" and fully groomed as well... :|

  even possible these days?
  maybe if "cookie x not set"?

make it look finer-er on mobile

can filter previews/trailers *this is really annoying*

== todo never LOL ==

There is a tiny blip of audio let me know if that bugs too much and I can look into it.

show details -> hide details

Add instructions for all sorts of weird stuff, like using Safari on mac (bookmarklet?) Safari on iOS, edge, FF...

decide and/or do personalized edits but publically usable :| woot

a real user profile adjust page LOL

an app that says "start this movie playing" (on that desktop computer) so they don't have to remote control anything

listen through this: https://developers.google.com/youtube/youtube_player_demo?csw=1

vimeo api??? :| legal? I've got like 3 movies on there only, man!

profile javascript is something in there expensive?

extension: always edit everything inline somehow?

edited amazon precursor ads :|

allow tags to be tagged with multiples "it's an opening scene and it's x" [?]

if you're on firefox, it should say "click here to be redirected to chrome" and it does but not clearly enough yet...

genre with scroll rights

get facebook gender
  and birthday LOL
  and profile pic

select by genre/original rating :|
  maybe just a search, flds style? :)

"sort by uplifting level" etc. ASK for more uplifting on facebook, do more
sortable index?
  once I get started :)
  most recent at top??
    I'd like it anyway...:)

figure out a way to do DB backups...though...actually..that other git is good, it would more be for freelds LOL

prettier movie url LOL
  one they can "like" on facebook'ish more? easily? share?

patent

better "contact us" form instead of recycling flds :|

try to negotiate with various sites [vudu etc.] that have junky ToS ... maybe we can reason with them... :(

groom the chrome plugin page...and get people to vote for it?

crystal: can sort compare Bool's
  double check, sockets should have some ping/timeout thing so I don't get stuck with old connections...at least that...
  slam it with wrk, everything barfs all over the place :(

  100% hang? <sniff>
  better JSON docs??
  fix kemal to not have arrays or strings yikes!

on amazon indexes list which ones are "editable" and also on its main page list "editable/which episodes editable" whoa!

a bit ugly on horizontal mobile chrome :| or was that only after a switch? but still...dat ain't good...

add year with dropdown [?]
  low prior for now let's hope mclintock was a freak...
  year is still barely kind of useful to people though...
  yeah prefer dropdown...  low priority

do we need more things people can enter in, like what common sense media has 3 different things?
test roku stream from desktop? LOL :|
shut down server more gracefully for restarts than hard kill :|
allow multiple genres per movie
series -> their own page [so you can just review that instead...]
"auto get" amazon second url, prime type for series' 

private list of edits are shareable...or does that only make sense in the other model?

an option "never show me r, or horror" :|

edited facebook vids LOL

missing any database indexes? check my queries uh guess...

more market research...maybe?

they can "at least playback" movies from google play index

  they can "change" movies from google play index

more plugins for edge, safari, [firefox mobile?]...if anybody cares...

ask netflix etc. 4 real (permission, or change ToS, or let's really partner LOL) :|
