== todo list (me ja, ordered) ==

figure out how to differentiate "2nd pass but not ready for kids" 
editing_status to num_edits_completed
  UI
add sell_it_edited
add advice_for_adult_personalization
add stuff_not_edited_out
add edit_most_recent_discovery_level
  cats for it: unedited, most recent pass added or modified edits.  most recent pass groomed some existing edits, groomed edits need review.  most recent pass created no new edits that need review ("totally done to level of 3 year old"). most recent pass found nothing new to edit but left in some material that was integral. no longer available on amazon

  maybe if "cookie x not set"?

list for "watch later" for them :)

add an "edited" tag underneath images in the amazon "watchlist" "my video library" page

attempt a real iOS app

only show the age dropdown if "required" for that tag type? or flash it red if the right type...

don't use access tokens as GET params, barely wonky...

edge plugin (for underpowered HTPC boxes )
  should be legal! 

IP:
  copy some vids (from youtube to the other place)

impact to story finish rename
  purchase_cost -> purchase_cost_hd

a real user profile adjust page LOL

an app that says "start this movie playing" (on that desktop computer) so they don't have to remote control anything

vimeo api??? :| legal? I've got like 3 movies on there only, man!

prettier movie url LOL
  one they can "like" on facebook'ish more? easily? share?

crystal:
  double check, sockets should have some ping/timeout thing so I don't get stuck with old connections...at least that...
  slam it with wrk, everything barfs all over the place :(
  stack traces come out so often, ugly
  various crystal bugs I could "help out with" (gzip, escape_javascript, server conns shuck...)
  figure out why query {"SELECT * from urls order by SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(SUBSTRING_INDEX(url, '&#x2F;', 3), ':&#x2F;&#x2F;', -1), '&#x2F;', 1), '?', 1), amazon_prime_free_type asc, create_timestamp desc, name, episode_number"} took 00:00:00.0634933
    takes 0.06 in crystal and 0.01 in mysql console :|

do we need more things people can enter in, like what common sense media has 3 different things?
test roku stream from desktop? LOL :|
shut down server more gracefully for restarts than hard kill :|
allow multiple genres per movie
series -> their own page [so you can just review that instead...]
"auto get" amazon second url, prime type for series' 

private list of edits are shareable...or does that only make sense in the other model?
resurrect "fake" netflix playback :|
can upload file for image

an option "never show me r, or horror" in index

ask those one people to link to me (enjoymoviesyourway)

they can "at least playback" movies from google play index
  jQuery(".playing-title").text() => "Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"
  they can "change" movies from google play index

ask netflix etc. 4 real (permission, or change ToS, or let's really partner LOL) :|
  "I would love to support you, 30000 users" etc. LOL have them spam him
  try to negotiate with various sites [vudu etc.] that have junky ToS ... maybe we can reason with them... :( (m/b don't have to wait)
