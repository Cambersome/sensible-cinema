  groom google?? first?
LLC
   talk to vidangel? maybe about "I"m a clearplay competitor" ...

does it make more sense with "action" and "default enabled"?

extension: episode to episode was saying "watching ad?" amazon broken here :|
easier chrome install (if they're on chrome I guess)
faq: mention wireless mouse,

personalized page:
  better "see all details" somehow...

  more "family" somehow...text, also image

research how to do kickstarters...ai ai...

allow tags to be tagged with multiple "it's an opening scene and it's x" [?]

this "froze" during the makeout scene, even though it should have been all "yes audio no video" up through and including the seek:
  https://playitmyway.org/edit_tag/3734

if you're on firefox, it should say "click here to be redirected to chrome" and it does but not clearly enough yet...
