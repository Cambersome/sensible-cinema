Warning: before grabbing any video files from your DVD's,
please consult the is_it_legal_to_copy_dvds.txt file to 
check for legal ramifications.  Don't do anything illegal in
your country.

Basically, sensible cinema affords you 2 options.

Either stick the DVD in then click the "realtime play" button.
Or you can "grab" a video file off a DVD, 
then Sensible Cinema will take it and slice and dice out the profanity et al, 
creating for you an edited version of the video file (for an example,
you could download the Big Buck Bunny DVD ISO, and try 
it out on that [1]).

Sensible Cinema only accepts raw "unencrypted" movie streams, 
so you're going to have to get the movie file off the DVD somehow first.
There are a few options.
A couple of ways are to run something similar to that described here [2]
(mplayer, or makemkv + tsmuxer)

Good luck!
